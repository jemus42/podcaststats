<p>I opted to leave out the plot for that data because <em>oh boy so many people</em>, so I hope everyone will be happy with the table.<br>
It was artisanally crafted as a gift to <em>The Incomparable</em> panelists and fans &lt;3</p>

<p>Here’s a searchable and sortable list of all the episodes released in 2025 (UTC, no freedom timestamps, sorry). There are multiple rows per episode, because each person gets their own row, which should make it a little easier to find out which person aprticipated in which episode. Because manually searching through <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/person/" class="uri">https://www.theincomparable.com/person/</a> would be almost like work.</p>
