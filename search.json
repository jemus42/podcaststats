This left only the option of crawling the ATP website for full episode metadata (which was annoying because of non-trivial URL parameters for pagination), which I was very much about to do… until I got Marco’s reply.\nSo… thanks Marco for saving me from the horrible fate that would have been a while loop in R.\nAt least that was the case, but ever since the ATP site relaunched in… 2020 or so? it was feasible so scrape the site and just leave it at that, as overcast feeds were not easily available programmatically anyway.
