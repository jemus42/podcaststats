This site is an automatically generated collection of plots and tables visualizing some metadata from my favorite podcasts/podcast networks.  

Included:

- [**The Incomparable**](https://www.theincomparable.com/)
- [**Accidental Tech Podcast (ATP)**](https://atp.fm/)
- [**Realy.fm**](https://www.relay.fm/)

Data includes episode runtimes, release dates, and hosts (in case of The Incomparable, also guests). 

The data sources are:

- **The Incomparable**: Home-brewed `stats.txt` files [Jason](https://twitter.com/jsnell) has set up for me to parse (thanks Jason <3)
- **Relay.fm**: The [master RSS feed]("https://www.relay.fm/master/feed")
- **ATP**: The [overcast feed](https://overcast.fm/itunes617416468/accidental-tech-podcast)

Data collection and site/plot-recreation happens daily at midnight UTC.
If you want to use this data for your own projects, you can download it from [here](/data)

## Note

This project is in a perpetual cycle of maintenance and "ain't nobody got time for that"-ness, which is primarily reflected in many of the plots not looking right.  
The reason is that whenever I tweaked the plot dimensions so that the spacing allows for all the text to be readable, it only takes a few months for multiple new podcasts to appear.  
Since the data collection and plot creation is automated and updated daily, this means the plots now have to fit more data, but since I haven't figured out a good way to auto-adjust the plot width accordingly, plots will look sqished after a few months.  


## All Shows

Here's a quick overview of the podcast data I've collected so far.  

```{r allshows}
relay %<>%
  mutate(
    number = as.character(number),
    year = year(date),
    date = as.POSIXct(date),
    network = "Relay.FM"
  )

atp %<>%
  filter(!is.na(month)) %>%
  mutate(
    number = as.character(number),
    year = year(date),
    date = as.POSIXct(date),
    network = "ATP",
    podcast = "ATP"
  )

incomparable_master_wide %<>%
  mutate(
    number = as.character(number),
    year = year(date),
    network = "The Incomparable"
  )

podcasts <- incomparable_master_wide %>%
  bind_rows(relay) %>%
  bind_rows(atp)

podcasts %>%
  group_by(network) %>%
  summarize(
    episodes = n(),
    duration_d = round(sum(duration, na.rm = TRUE) / 60 / 24),
    duration_avg = round(mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE)),
    firstep = as.character(as.Date(min(date, na.rm = TRUE))),
    lastep = as.character(as.Date(max(date, na.rm = TRUE))),
    shows = length(unique(podcast)),
    epspershow = round(episodes / shows, 1)
  ) %>%
  set_colnames(c(
    "Network", "Episodes", "Duration (total, days)",
    "Duration (mean, mins)", "First Episode",
    "Last Episode", "# of Shows", "Episodes per Show"
  )) %>%
  datatable()
```

## All Shows Timeline

From first to last published episode.

```{r allshows_timeline, fig.height=16}
podcasts %>%
  group_by(podcast) %>%
  mutate(
    d_min = min(date),
    d_max = max(date)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(podcast, d_min), color = network)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = d_min, ymax = d_max), width = .5, size = 2) +
  scale_x_discrete(position = "top") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  labs(
    title = "All Podcasts Timeline",
    subtitle = "The Incomparable, Relay.fm, ATP",
    x = "", y = "First to Latest Episode Date",
    color = "Network",
    caption = caption
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```


## All Shows by Duration

```{r allshows_duration, fig.height=16}
podcasts %>%
  filter(!is.na(duration)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(podcast, duration, FUN = mean), y = duration, fill = network)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  labs(
    title = "Podcasts by Duration", subtitle = "By Network",
    x = "", y = "Duration (mins)", fill = "Network"
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```


## Placeholder Quickie: Defocused vs. Reconcilable Differences

```{r recdiffs_vs_defocused}
defocused <- readRDS("data/incomparable_master_wide.rds") %>%
  filter(podcast == "Defocused") %>%
  mutate(
    number = as.numeric(number),
    year = as.numeric(year)
  )

recdiffs <- readRDS("data/relay.rds") %>%
  filter(podcast == "Reconcilable Differences") %>%
  mutate(date = as.POSIXct(date))

data <- bind_rows(recdiffs, defocused)

ggplot(data = data, aes(x = podcast, y = duration, fill = podcast)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = .5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(.25, .75), alpha = .5, show.legend = FALSE) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 2, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  labs(
    title = "Defocused vs. Reconcilable Differences",
    subtitle = "Comparison of Show Durations (Violin Plot)",
    x = "", y = "Duration (mins)", fill = "Show"
  )
```
