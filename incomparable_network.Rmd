## 2017 Hosts and Guests

```{r 2017_panelists_network, fig.height=14}
incomparable %>% 
  filter(year == 2017) %>%
  group_by(person, role) %>%
  tally() %>%
  spread(role, n) %>% 
  replace_na(list(guest = 0, host = 0)) %>%
  mutate(total = guest + host) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  datatable(style = "bootstrap", colnames = c("Person", "Guest", "Host", "Total Appearances"))
```

I opted to leave out the plot for that data because *oh boy so many people*, so I hope everyone will be happy with the table.  
It was artisanally crafted as a gift to *The Incomparable* panelists and fans <3
