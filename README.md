Preparing data about podcasts. Because why not.

Based off my previous work at [jemus42/theincompaRable](https://github.com/jemus42/theincompaRable), but now more organized.

## About

Well, [Jason Snell tweeted](https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/700864025949655040) a graph of The Incomparable runtimes.  
As a big fan of the podcast and an aspiring nerd, [I asked for the data, obviously](https://twitter.com/Jemus42/status/700864609083850753).  
I was happy to [receive his .numbers file](https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/700864809537970176), but unfortunately [it only contained two variables](https://twitter.com/Jemus42/status/700870531697004544) - the two needed for the plot.  
Jason replied [he could get more metadata if I liked](https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/700870702367318017) and since I **really really would like** that, I rushed to set up this repository and put on my data-pants.  
A short time after that, [Jason delivered magnificiently](https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/700882298795765761).  
And now my analysis began.

After I was sufficiently satisfied with my results, I began branching out to [Realy FM](https://relay.fm).  
I am now trying to analyze data from both networks in a neat and tidy way.
