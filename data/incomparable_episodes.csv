The modern sensibility and soundtrack laid over the historical invasion of rich American debutants into cash-strapped British upper-class society make for an energetic vibe. If you missed it, our Agents recommend catching up before joining us for a good gossip about the collection of characters. In lieu of research, these Agents have chosen to go for wild historical speculations. Warning!

We are starting with the 2005 movie that shows Great Truths Hidden Under the Fantastical. On the surface, this is a movie about two married spies flirting by trying to kill each other.

And what better way to celebrate than with the Christmas action movie Long Kiss Goodnight with Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson?

Ghosted matches up Chris Evans and Ana de Armas again in a spy/not a spy action adventure. We don’t recommend it as a stalkering road map for finding love IRL, but it is full of chases, OTT villains, and a plot that takes us across the globe. If you want a fun escape with pretty people in nice clothes chasing MacGuffins, this movie is about as deep as you need it to be.;The Incomparable

This is a movie our agents know by heart but they are coming back to after a long period of absence. Does this change our perspective of the classic romantic adventure? We dive right in with a focus on the romance between Princess Buttercup and her Wesley. Is it a great epic romance?

But our Agents find the movie Fifty Shades of Grey lacking in chemistry and rather mechanical. We bring a new Agent with kink expertise on this mission to help us discuss our feelings about the book series, movie, and what we wish it could be. What do we want? More fun and humour and joy in the film’s portrayal of sex and romance. And montages. Sexy, sexy montages. The real question is: Can we do a Moisés style mini-series and make it good? Warning! This is episode is marked explicit just so Agent Moisés can properly express the depth of his feelings. We also are talking about sex, consent, and kink, a lot. ;The Incomparable

It was an unusual one, and included themes a modern audience tends to read as gay. Well guess what? We’re doing it again. Desert Fury puts Lizbeth Scott, Bert Lancaster and John Hodiak into a love triangle. Film noir expert Eddie Muller says this is the gayest movie ever produced in classic Hollywood. But is it? Please enjoy the lush color, and the Miklos Rosza score.  And look, there’s Mary Astor and Kristine Miller, too. So we have a very noir cast getting together to ride a present-day version of the range.;The Incomparable

It also led to three more Airport films, and the adaptation of Zero Hour (also a Hailey story) into Airplane!. This second installment, Airport 1975, celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. It straddles the line between big budget, all-star A picture (the original), and implausible 70s schlock, as observed in the final two Airport films.

It’s in my personal top five. This movie is considered the masterpiece by legendary filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu, and it stars his luminous muse, Setsuko Hara. Tokyo Story is a black and white time capsule of life in Japan after World War II and depicts how the war and Japan’s modernization disrupted its family dynamic. Compared with the boldness of Akira Kurosawa’s movies, it’s sedate and thoughtful, and you may easily find yourself shedding a tear or two.;The Incomparable

Mastroianni is a tabloid journalist, and we follow him through seven stories, during the film. Anita Ekberg is the female star probably most known to American film fans.

As his weapon gets used in a series of escalating, awful crimes, the young detective and his savvy mentor (Takashi Shimura) must race through the underworld to track down the shooter and get it back.

The great precode lothario stars with very young Loretta Young and Wallace Ford (who we just saw as a middle-aged creep in The Breaking Point) as her love interest.

And it’s our first LTS western. Because maybe your show runner has a slightly twisted appreciation for the genre. Nicholas Ray, whose directorial chops we last experienced with In A Lonely Place, directs Joan Crawford, Sterling Hayden and Mercedes McCambridge. It’s a story that centers female characters, and gives Joan a chance to stomp around in great western wardrobe. Poor Sterling Hayden is just along for the ride.

This one stars John Garfield (in one of his final films) and Patricia Neal. Michael Curtiz directs, but if that suggests a routine Warner Bothers potboiler (I love those) it is not.

Loehr";NA;Sullivan’s Travels: Class Tourism, with a Little Sex;Preston Sturgess was in top form in 1941 for this comedy starring Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake - in one of her first films. McCrea is a movie director, looking for a way to make a “socially relevant” film, instead of the comedies he’s been making. McCrea travels as a hobo, trying to “know trouble” in a way he can’t while living his life as a Hollywood director. Like Orson Welles, Sturges used a stock company of character actors, and many of them are along for the ride. ;The Incomparable

Add in the wonderful and underrated Gladys George, and you’ve got yourself a movie! Raoul Walsh, whose career went back to silents, and who would later direct Cagney in “White Heat,” directed. “The Roaring Twenties” is part social commentary, crime movie and melodrama.

Neither John nor your regular hosts had ever seen Scarface. We fixed that.Of course, Siracusa’s known for being hypercritical. Will Oliver Stone’s script, Brian De Palma’s directing, and Al Pacino’s acting be enough to impress him, or will Scarface need to say hello to John’s little friend: grudging disdain?Hot topics include what makes a gangster movie successful, random characters who suddenly become the center of attention during the climactic conclusion, and man, is Michelle Pfeiffer beautiful.Want to support the show?

We took a few weeks off, but then we felt that longing, that need to once again share the joy of watching a movie most everyone has seen, but that at least one of us hasn’t.In this case, Dan introduced Lex to 1992’s Sneakers, which Lex repeatedly attempted to confuse with the Angelina Jolie starrer Hackers. Sneakers is not Hackers, as Dan patiently explained to Lex. Repeatedly. For a movie about cryptography and hacking, Sneakers holds up surprisingly well.Hot topics include Lex’s confusion between Robert Redford and Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley’s New Jersey accent or lack thereof, and stock characters.Support the show by watching Sneakers via Amazon streaming, or by grabbing the movie from iTunes.

Hot topics include whether all sales people are really like this, similarities between Mamet and Aaron Sorkin, and enjoying a movie where there’s no one in particular to root for.We suggest that after you watch (and listen), you follow it up with a viewing of Alec Baldwin delivering his famous Glengarry speech on Saturday Night Live—while motivating Santa’s elves.

And that man, of course, is Connery. Sean Connery.This week, Dan invites Lex to see a movie for the first time—a movie where Connery gets precisely such a role: 1990’s The Hunt for Red October. Lex had been in the theater for this film once, years ago, but he fell asleep after just a few minutes.That doesn’t happen this time. Or does it?!Hot topics include unsubtle language transitions, submarine lingo, and whatever the word is for that narrative device where you know more, and also less, than the other characters do. (It’s probably German.)Support Not Playing by streaming The Hunt For Red October from Amazon or iTunes. And while you’re there, go ahead and leave us a review, won’t you, tovarisch? ;The Incomparable

But perhaps no pair of brothers has become so famous for an extended masturbation joke as the brothers Farrelly.Dan had never seen their, ahem, seminal 1998 classic There’s Something About Mary. After learning of Dan’s appreciation for the comedy in movies like Army of Darkness and Hudson Hawk, Lex felt like he had a good chance of entertaining Dan with Stiller/Diaz/Dillon hijinks.You’ll have to listen to learn whether Lex was right. Hot topics include stunt dogs, the brothers Dillon, and cringeworthy comedy. You can watch along with us by streaming the film from Amazon or iTunes.

Other times, they are EVIL dead. But one thing will never die: Dan’s affection for Army of Darkness, the third film in Sam Raimi’s Evil Dead trilogy—which Lex had never seen.Hot topics include director trademarks, when campiness works, and homages to movies that we also haven’t seen.You can watch along with us by streaming the film—we used the theatrical release version—from Amazon or iTunes.Dan apologizes for the occasional trucks you’ll hear driving past his open window. But that was better than his suffering heatstroke in the midst of enjoying Bruce Campbell’s fine performance.;The Incomparable

And he’s joined by Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder, and Catherine O’Hara. It’s 1988’s Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice!Dan had never seen it, but Lex remembered the film fondly.

And that project is the 1991 box-office bomb—but cult classic!—Hudson Hawk. Lex, like much of America, hadn’t seen it. And, at Dan’s insistence, Lex did no research of any kind; he had no idea what to expect as he watched it with Dan for the first time. In retrospect, Lex thinks maybe he should have been drunk. At least as drunk as Willis himself must have been when he conceived the film.Hot topics include whether this is David Caruso’s best role, the perfection of a certain runaway stretcher scene, and how stupid is too stupid for comedy.";The Incomparable

Jeremy says the line “It cannot, it must not rain at Indian Wells” (anybody want to guess whether it starts raining?) Meanwhile, Jeremy is a bit nervous because he invited his new girlfriend to visit the studio. And Dana has an inexplicable bandage on her face? Lex and Brian think some of this makes sense, and some … less so. Either way, all this talk of rain tells me we’ll definitely be Sorkin’ In It!;The Incomparable

You can bet that goes over like a fart in church. Speaking of church - Dana visits one to get out of the rain… and likes it (the church, not the rain… or the fart). The rain also helps Jeremy continue his flirtation with Jenny. There’s so much Sorkin In It to do. We got you. ;The Incomparable

(Wait a sec. Lex, did you write this? I happen to like Tom Waits. Anyway…) Dana inherits a gun, which is also strange (OK, we both agree here). William H.

Instead we have a silly subplot about a “Who’s cooler, Dan or Casey” online poll and way too much time spent dwelling on undergarments.

One is a ridiculous movie about teen hackers that knows it’s silly, and the other is a ludicrous thriller about adult hackers that doesn’t.;The Incomparable

Dune. Desert Planet. But maybe not the one you’re thinking of. In our own very peculiar way we honor David Lynch by discussing the feature film he probably liked the least, 1984’s “Dune.” Sting with a knife! Patrick Stewart riding a sandworm!

Guillermo Del Toro’s “Pan’s Labyrinth” toggles effortless between bizarre, Miyazaki-like fantasy (inverted toads!) and an all-too-real tale of violence and treachery in fascist Spain. It’s dark, beautiful, full of disgusting bugs, and manages to use Del Toro muse Doug Jones as not one but two separate monsters! ;The Incomparable

Surprisingly holding down the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe for 2024 is “Deadpool & Wolverine,” in which Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman desecrate “Logan” while honoring it, skewer Marvel movies while saving them, and encounter an extremely unlikely collection of Marvel movie cast-offs and has-beens. ;The Incomparable

Chris Sarandon is the perfect vampire, even when he’s villanously chowin’ down on a topless lady as he exchanges intense stares with the neighbor kid.

It’s 1980’s “Airplane!”—the comedy version of “Zero Hour!”—with serious actors playing ridiculous parts more or less straight. How does the comedy hold up? What’s unique about the approach?

Old Movie Club celebrates Aviatober with 1939’s “Only Angels Have Wings” and 1957’s “Zero Hour!” One bears a striking resemblance to forgettable 1980s TV series “Tales of the Gold Monkey,” and the other is undeniably the inspiration for the more notable 1980 movie “Airplane!” (That’s foreshadowing.);The Incomparable

Come back with us to look at his run on Animal Man, issues 1-26, in which a has-been/never-was superhero becomes an outspoken animal rights activist, witnesses the near-undoing of the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and meets his own maker—who looks strangely like Grant Morrison.

Maybe it’s the shock of seeing young Sir Kenneth Branagh (attempting a weird American accent) and Dame Emma Thompson. Maybe it’s Sir Derek Jacobi making us wonder if that stutter is an “I, Claudius” reference.

We make time for “No Time to Die,” of course, and the rest of the Daniel Craig era. How does it hold up, where does it go from here, what would we like to see?

In 1954’s “Suddenly,” Frank Sinatra’s going to try to kill the President. In 1964’s “Seven Days In May,” Burt Lancaster is plotting a military coup. Both films are in black and white from more than 50 years ago, and yet for some reason Phil thinks their themes may resonate even today…;The Incomparable

(There is also a chimp.) We’ll discuss how this film fits into the Wachowskis’ canon, the supporting character whose story is way more interesting than the leadâ€š and the only other big-budget film since that has dared to get this stylistically weird.;The Incomparable

Or at least that’s who we’d be in our version of the HBO Max miniseries, “Station Eleven.” We discuss the moving, optimistic post-apocalyptic tale that is told in a fractured time sequence and features lots of Shakespeare and a suspiciously powerful self-published graphic novel. And though there’s definitely no “Station Twelve” on the horizon, we can’t help but imagine what other stories are there just waiting to never be told.;The Incomparable

Murray Abraham. In this case it’s “Last Action Hero,” a movie that Wikipedia claims is a cult classic. We don’t know about that, but it certainly is unjustly maligned. This is a big, loud action movie that is also a parody and celebration of big, loud action movies. Sure, it’s got its flaws—we’re looking at you, kid—but there’s a whole lot to like.;The Incomparable

This is an amazing show with a fantastic cast about a bunch of geeks and burnouts in Michigan in the early 1980s. It’s a sweet and funny and awkward and painful story about growing up and trying to figure out who you are, while everyone else in the world wants to label you and make sure you never forget your label. We discuss our favorite ancillary characters, the richness of the world of “Freaks and Geeks”, and how upon rewatching the show 20 years later, we have gained even more appreciation for Mr. and Mrs. Weir.;The Incomparable

First it’s the news that Russell T Davies, who brought “Doctor Who” back in 2005, is reuniting with his producers from that era to produce and write the show. Then came the announcement that J. Michael Straczynski has been contracted with The CW to write a pilot for a rebooted “Babylon 5.” Can you go home again? Will they play the hits or strike out in new directions?

Not only be it days from the equinox, but it be International Talk Like a Pirate Day. What better time to wrap up the Summer of Spielberg with “Hook,” a (misguided?) Peter Pan sequel starring Robin Williams as Peter, Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, and Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, all gallivanting around a very crowded and overlit stage-set version of Neverland. We discuss the movie’s appeal to early-nineties kids, Spielberg’s commercial sensibility as a director, and the film’s many misguided creative decisions.;The Incomparable

We’ve taken out our surgical tools to diagnose just what went wrong with “Ready Player One,” in which a director who is much more interested in movies than video games and who himself deeply influenced 80s culture is put in charge of a too-faithful adaptation of a book about video games and 80s culture. We spent a lot of our time imagining a much better movie that could have been made instead of this one.;The Incomparable

We cover 2005’s “War of the Worlds,” starring Tom Cruise as a dad who just wants to protect his kids from the end of the world. Well, maybe one of his kids. Screaming! Explosions! Implausible plot points! Not enough Miranda Otto! Maybe too much Tim Robbins! The 9/11 influence is strong in this one.;The Incomparable

The Summer of Spielberg continues with 2002’s “Minority Report,” a sci-fi noirish murder mystery combined with a vision of the future and a dose of social commentary.

Whether it works for you may hinge entirely on if you consider it a science-fiction story or a fairy tale. We marvel at some great performances, are frustrated by some creative choices, and in the end find ourselves applauding the boldness of the ending.

(And some of us didn’t.) This is a movie delayed from pre-COVID times, it’s the first Marvel movie in the Disney+ era, and it’s set during 2016’s “Captain America: Civil War”—conveniently before the main character dies. With all that, it’s also a film that puts its title heroine at the center of a “Mission: Impossible” style story that’s also, strangely, about a couple of particularly messed-up families.;The Incomparable

While not officially part of the Cornetto Trilogy, this British alien-invasion film shares a lot of DNA with those movies, and it’s about as close an analog to “Shaun of the Dead” as you’ll find—but with the comedy dial turned down a bit. It features career-making performances by John Boyega and Jodie Whittaker, who went on to become the faces of famous sci-fi franchises. And after the last 10 years, some of the social commentary in this film hits home more than ever. Allow it! ;The Incomparable

Loehr;Moisés Chiullán";The Incomparable Mothership;“Megamind”;Olo! It’s time to discuss an underappreciated superhero movie that’s only become more relevant after a decade full of superhero movies. It’s 2010’s “Megamind,” which transcends being an extrusion from the Dreamworks animation factory (well, except for its pop-music soundtrack) to become something greater. With an all-star cast led by Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, this is a great riff on the Superman mythos and the true meaning of destiny and heroism. Code: It’s great.;The Incomparable

Marvel’s second Disney+ series, “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” picks up the story of two of Captain America’s pals as they confront serious societal issues, the representation of America in the modern age, and a gaggle of super-powered foes. It’s a show that takes some big swings, even if it does get a bit muddled, and we discuss its ambitions, what it gets right, and where it misses the mark.;The Incomparable

Does it matter that the main characters are generic, or does it actually help? Is this a slasher film or more of a smasher film? Why did it kick off a nonsensical franchise of unrelated movies? And if it was made today, how would it be different? (Hint: Less shaky-cam!) Find a quiet place to hide somewhere and join us!;The Incomparable

It’s time to discuss 1981 South African karate movie “Kill and Kill Again,” a film featuring many middle-aged men kicking people, as well as a James Bond-style plot about a madman who wants to take over the world via an unusual application of potatoes. We cover strange ties to “CSI: Miami” and “The A-Team,” introduce you to the wonders of Hot Dog and his bag of tricks, weigh the movie’s knowing sexism against its unflinching racism, and contemplate Villanous Operations and how they are named.

An ecological disaster leads to the breakup of an enemy empire, but in “Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country” it’s the Klingon moon Praxis subbing in for the Soviet power station Chernobyl. Kirk and company struggle with their animosity toward the Klingons, but we are more concerned with what graduate school Gorkon’s daughter went to, the Klingon guard who carries a box, the one Klingon who laughed at McCoy’s joke, the importance of gaseous anomalies to Federation politics, and the lack of respect given to the Enterprise court reporter. Discussing this movie must’ve been our lifelong ambition.;The Incomparable

This episode is Phil’s revenge, as we watch two acclaimed early-80s films and see how well they hold up. They’re both period pieces, but one is set to the electronic sounds of Vangelis and the other to the classical masterpieces of Mozart.

We discuss the play, the unpleasant Franco Zeffirelli 1967 film starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, the film and TV versions of Cole Porter’s “Kiss Me, Kate,” the teen rom-com “10 Things I Hate About You,” and even the 1980s TV adaptation on “Moonlighting,” which might be the best of the bunch?

It’s “What We Do in the Shadows,” a show that honors vampire lore while placing them in ridiculous mundane situations. A mockumentary sitcom featuring vampires might seem like an entry from TV Mad Libs, but this show (based on an indie feature film also by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi) uses its stellar cast and sharp writing to create a bizarre world of energy vampires, complaining familiars, new-age witches, and—the horror—local politics. ;The Incomparable

And from the early days of Beatlemania comes 1964’s “A Hard Day’s Night”, intended (at least by its financiers) to be disposable boy-band fluff, but ended up being one of the most influential films of the 20th century. ;The Incomparable

And it’s also a fascinating historical document, given that it was written before Pearl Harbor and produced in the early days of America’s involvement in World War II, when the end of the war was anything but a foregone conclusion. We discuss the magical letters of transit, Captain Renault’s jocular amorality, Victor Laszlo the speechifying drip, Ilsa’s piercing stare, Major Strasser’s favorite cereal, Sam’s implausible piano handwork, the Ken Cinema in San Diego, and how the war was like a rap battle.;The Incomparable

In this special episode, Jason and Antony discuss the origin of the graphic novel “The Coldest City”, why some stories fit better as graphic novels rather than serialized comics, the value of taking some time to indulge passion projects, the process of having Hollywood option your story, and the choices made when adapting a story from one medium into another.

They made a good Spider-Man movie! But did Tony Stark save the day, or just get in the way? Does Michael Keaton give a better villain performance than he ever did as a superhero? Did Tom Holland wear the suit, or did the suit (which talks, by the way) wear him?

Our brave panelists watch 2000’s “Dungeons & Dragons”, which features dungeons, dragons, a horribly unbalanced party, an infuriating lack of connection to the game, a set of polar-opposite performances by Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch, a six-foot-tall “dwarf”, political theater even more boring than The Phantom Menace, generous garnishes of racism and sexism, and a villain who wears blue lipstick.

Every choice you make and every fact you uncover could completely change the story… or more likely, change the details a little bit.

Robert De Niro stars as young Vito Corleone, who comes to America and learns how to become The Godfather. And Al Pacino stars as Michael Corleone, trying to live up to the standard set by his father in the first film.

Dan’s book, “The Caledonian Gambit,” was released today. Seven years ago, before The Incomparable even existed, Jason read a draft of Dan’s book… proving that sometimes the road to having your book published can be a long one, but with talent and perseverance it can be done.

The show’s second season recently completed on American screens, so we’ve gathered to discuss the latest developments. It’s a unique mixing of big ideas and domestic life, but does the second season suffer from the show’s reluctance to make major changes at the end of season one? What made this season so frustrating, so often? Which storylines worked—and which ones were missed opportunities? Why does Carrie Anne Moss keep talking to blades of grass stored on a server? Why would any human want to be a Synth? What’s Mark Zuckerberg doing here? We cover it all.;The Incomparable

Based on a series of books by Lev Grossman, this is a show that starts out as a mash-up of Harry Potter and Narnia and goes in some very surprising directions while continually improving in quality. Love, war, sex, fairies, gods (some evil, some capricious, some just annoying)—there’s a lot to love about this show. In the first half of the episode we talk generally about the show and why we like it; the second half, after the Spoiler Horn, is devoted to breaking down the events of its just-completed second season.(Content advisory: “The Magicians” contains a couple examples of sexual assault/abuse.

This isn’t another superhero comic adaptation, but something unlike anything we’ve seen before—a visual and auditory feast, great actors, and smart writing that will make sure you sit up and pay attention. If you’ve written off comic-book TV shows and movies, time to circle back and appreciate this eight-episode first season from writer/producer Noah Hawley (“Fargo”). Expensive music! Beautiful sets! And actors who used to be in “Downton Abbey”, “Parks & Recreation”, and “Designing Women”! What more could you ask for?;The Incomparable

Night Shyamalan’s follow-up “Unbreakable” was seen as a disappointment, but we think it deserves a critical reappraisal. 2000 was a desert for superhero movies, but “Unbreakable” actually seems more impressive after 15 years of modern takes on the genre. We discuss the film’s interesting color palette, the weight of a full paint can, the water-resisting qualities of Bruce Willis’s green poncho, why anyone would like the colors rust and brown, and the practicality of Samuel L. Jackson carrying a glass cane. And stick around—I hear this one’s got a surprise ending.;The Incomparable

Loehr";The Incomparable Mothership;“Star Wars: The Force Awakens”, a fourth view;Our many-part analysis of “The Force Awakens” continues. In this episode we praise the casting of Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac, and ponder how the diversity of the “Star Wars” universe has increased. Plus, did Luke hide something in all the droids? Why does Finn hold a lightsaber like a baseball bat? Why would one of the Weasley brothers become a fascist? And ultimately, why is this film redemptive for the franchise as a whole?;The Incomparable

Also, Scott keeps bringing up “Star Trek.”;The Incomparable

In this installment, we travel across the pond for a panel predominantly made up of residents of the UK. Why are there Scottish people in space? Who is the face of fresh young fascism? Where can we get red replacement arms?;The Incomparable

What spoilers have we avoided? (This episode certainly contains none.) What does it mean that “Star Wars” is now an extended film franchise releasing new films annually? How many times are we going to see the film next weekend, and how will we find time to podcast about it? And perhaps most importantly, can any new “Star Wars” movie ever possibly hope to capture the excitement we felt when we discovered these films as children?;The Incomparable

But while Scarlett Johansson’s Samantha wants to send a ‘Dear John’ update to all humanity, Alicia Vikander’s Ava has more in mind than pleasant dinner conversation.

But with the announcement came a bunch of interesting details (it’s going to be exclusive to CBS’ streaming service, it’s going to be produced by one of the co-writers of the J.J. Abrams “Star Trek” movies) and a lack of specifics (they’re still interviewing writers and didn’t announce even the most basic of premises). Our panel of Star Trek fans analyzes the interesting decisions CBS has made so far, tries to imagine how a “Star Trek” series from 2017 might differ from its predecessors, and discusses the importance of creating a series that can keep the franchise alive by appealing to a new generation of fans.;The Incomparable

Our final battle with the “Star Wars” prequels is our take on “Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.” After a long string of opening statements, we take on the crawl and the first few scenes of the film. Why does a droid wheeze? Why are villains introduced off screen? Why is Christopher Lee wasted? What’s the deal with all the elevators? Why is Darth Vader a chump? Why is there even more boring political science? What happened to Natalie Portman, and why is she wearing beaded bedclothes while standing on balconies? Then we take you all the way through the dissatisfying ending, and as a bonus, we try to rank the prequels and discover a surprising winner.[This episode was originally two episodes, 237 and 238. It’s been rejoined into a single, double-length episode.];The Incomparable

How do the film’s Cold War themes contrast with its anti-technology themes? Can a computer make moral decisions? Why is there so much nerd shaming and sexism? And why do they let tour buses into the heart of America’s nuclear command? So many questions, Professor Falken, and so few remote-controlled pterodactyls.;The Incomparable

We also talk about Bacigalupi’s particular brand of eco-apocalypse, his use of science fiction to make us reconsider what’s going on today in the world, and how to pronounce his name.

We discuss Joss Whedon’s Marvel movie, which has been a hit with audiences and critics. But some members of our panel don’t agree. How much do expectations factor in to one’s enjoyment of a movie? Has the bar for summer action blockbusters been set too low by the likes of “Transformers 2”? Should every action-adventure movie aspire to be something more?

Isn’t it sad how Boba Fett goes out with a whimper? Are the alien languages in “Star Wars” too fake-sounding? How is Luke’s journey to being a Jedi not like what you see in most action movies? Who is more heroic in the end, Luke or Vader? Why does the Emperor wait so long to show us his lightning fingers? Why are rebel ships equipped with fireworks? And is Endor the name of the moon, or the name of the planet the moon is orbiting, or both? [This episode was originally two episodes, 88 and 89.

Akers joins us to talk about Murder Under Glass, an episode from the final season of the original NBC run of Columbo featuring Louis Jourdan as a food critic and, of course, a murderer. It is maybe not the most perfect episode, but well worth a visit for the variations on the formula—people are actually happy to see the good Lieutenant for once, and he gets to show off some serious culinary skills.We also get to talking about Will’s own mystery novels. Somehow, we wind up talking about Mack Bolan, the Executioner, of all things. And role playing games. And baseball. Oh, and there’s a little touch of film noir right at the start…;The Incomparable

Loehr;Shannon Sudderth";NA;Mystery series we initially enjoyed and then gave up on;We’ve all started reading down mystery series or authors, and then hit a point where we said, “nah, I’m good.” In this episode, we talk about what we gave up on and why, and some we loved all throughout. This comes from a place of love: we enjoyed early installments enough that we kept reading, but something eventually got lost for us. In fact, we often recommend the first few or even several novels, and tell you when the best point to stop is —Â the subtitle of this episode is “exactly when to stop reading.”An important note: this episode was accidentally recorded with macabre timing. The first author we discuss on this show, Sue Grafton, passed away while we were recording the episode — that same evening. We obviously didn’t know while recording, and found out the next morning. Thus, we speak about her as a current writer. We’ve edited the episode to remove some discussion about the planned final novel in her series, Z, which her family says wasn’t written and which they won’t hire someone else to write.Some Afoot news: we haven’t been able to get enough panelists together for regular tapings, so we’re going on hiatus.

The two films have a lot in common, including Robert Moore as director, Peter Falk as the Bogie analog, and Madeline Kahn in a wonderful supporting role in each. But the Afoot panel prefers one to the other. Which one?

Nearly every episode of the long-running TV character (across two series and 69 episodes) showed viewers the murder at its start. Columbo, a police detective, is brought in on the case, and we see the killer becoming increasingly agitated as he relentlessly circles his prey.

It’s an extremely silly parody of postapocalyptic movies made by people (in 2009) who were both comedians and Scarecrow employees, which means that they’re pals of Rhias’s. It’s really funny, though, and we try to convey that in our very fond discussion of it.;The Incomparable
Monty and Rhias vs. Movies;11;The Postman;00:28:58;2020-09-11;2020;September;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;NA;A three-hour movie directed by, and starring, Kevin Costner as the man who brings society back from the postapocalypse by sheer force of downright decent-ness.

At best, there are three square blocks of postapocalypse, and some of it might be Brooklyn. A lot of it is definitely Rome.

Monty and Rhias vs. Movies;8;Atolladero;00:37:45;2020-07-10;2020;July;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Atolladero;This movie is very gross! And Monty and Rhias talk about it frankly and with swear words. Atolladero was made in 1995 and it is very much one of those movies made right after Pulp Fiction where they just pile on the drugs and violence and transgressive behavior and so forth. It appeared in a few film festivals and then had a limited release in Spain, so it’s kind of a miracle that Rhias ever got her hands on this third-generation VHS copy. Anyway, it’s kind of a spaghetti western noir in a postapocalyptic setting, made in Spain, and Iggy Pop is in it.;The Incomparable
Monty and Rhias vs. Movies;7;Wheels of Fire;00:33:44;2020-06-22;2020;June;Sunday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Wheels of Fire;Wheels of Fire was shot in the Philippines and has probably the most explosions of any movie we’ve seen in this Postapocalyptic year. It also contains a telepathic woman, a woman who appears to have a psychic link with a hawk, and an actual Playboy Playmate. And yet? Extremely boring. And it is very unkind to its female characters, especially the aforementioned Playmate. This episode is marked “explicit” because there was no other way to discuss the gross parts.;The Incomparable

It is a story you’ve heard before, with motorcycles and weird leather clothing, and plague mutants. Well, we’re not told that those guys were mutants, but they probably were. Stands to reason, right? This movie was made in Turkey in 1986 and it is fun.;The Incomparable

Where the crew accidentally go back in time and try to set right what they messed up by trying to make sure they didn’t mess history up. But this isn’t your typical time travel episode where things all turn out the same or better in the end. Afterall, this is Farscape we’re talking about.Finally the really dark episode, “Eat Me”. Farscape’s survival horror episode. Where the crew fend off cannibalistic pseudo-zombies and a mad scientist on a diseased and dying Leviathan. And where the ending leaves the crew seeing double… double Crichtons.;The Incomparable

And it’s not a happy, fun time for our wayward crew.First up — “Self-Inflicted Wounds (Part 1): Could’a, Would’a, Should’a”. While on their way to a planet that can help Zhaan heal, Moya runs across a wormhole. Before anyone can do anything, a ship comes out of it and materializes part way inside Moya. The crews of both ships work on ways to separate themselves, but it seems the aliens on the other ship have ulterior motives. And we meet our newest crewmember - Jool.Finally in “Self-Inflicted Wounds (Part 2): Wait for the Wheel”, we learn that the aliens are sabotaging Moya so their ship can be the only one to escape the wormhole. Our crew must put their differences of opinions and desires aside to save them all before the aliens’ plans are realized. And one of our crew makes the ultimate sacrifice.;The Incomparable

They jump into the beginning of season three — which now has new opening theme music, “new” cast members and a new narration.First up, the exciting conclusion to the end of season two, “Season of Death”. That’s the name of the episode, not the name of the last season… Does Aeryn come back to life? Does Crichton get his head back together, both literally and psychologically? Does Rygel really like what Chiana’s cooking?Then we wrap up with “Suns and Lovers”. Where we hopefully put the whole D’Argo / Chiana / Jothee love triangle behind us, never to be spoken of again. And not just because the crew is trapped on a disabled space station about to be destroyed by a mysterious wave of energy soon approaching. Can they find the source of the signal attracting the wave in time? Can they saved the trapped children and themselves? And can Aeryn and Crichton finally find some “alone time”?;The Incomparable

Instead of using their newly obtained mercenaries to rescue D’Argo’s son, now they’re off to rescue Crichton from Scorpius’ clutches. But don’t worry, Stark has another foolproof plan… ah, frell that, it’s time for a guns blazing, frontal assault! They manage to rescue Crichton, but at what cost?Finally, “Die Me, Dichotomy”, the (mostly) exciting season two cliffhanger. The crew locates a healer who can both heal Moya and get the neural chip out of Crichton’s head. But the chip isn’t having any of that and does its best to get itself, and Crichton, back to Scorpius. And then some other things happen that we’d like to forget about, before the exciting cliffhanger ending that sets up season three.;The Incomparable

And during all that, wander off on tangents about Star Wars, the A-Team and past episodes of this here podcast.First up, “Part 1 - A Not So Simple Plan”. Which is pretty much as advertised. Stark (hey, isn’t he dead?) has a not so simple plan to steal enough money to buy D’Argo’s son Jothee from the slavers holding him captive.  With such a complicated plan, it goes off without any issues at all.  No… who are we kidding?  Of course not.  The crew must deal with a heavily secured depository, its leader, and our old buddy Scorpius to get what they need.Finally, “Part 2 - With Friends Like These…”.  After learning that all their efforts last time weren’t quite good enough, this time it’s Crichton who comes up with his own somewhat simpler plan to free Jothee.  But it involves recruiting several people we met in season one who they didn’t leave on the best of terms with.  It goes better than you’d expect, but there’s yet another complication that might make their hard work all for naught.  And Crichton has to make a hard choice…;The Incomparable

But things don’t go according to plan and the crew has to recount, from each of their perspectives, what went wrong or else face summary execution.Finally, “A Clockwork Nebari”, where Chiana learns some truths, some ugly, some not-so-ugly, about her people and her brother. Meanwhile the crew is mentally cleansed by the aforementioned Nebari and have to snap out of it if they’re going to get away.  It’s like totally bitchin’, man. Far out.;The Incomparable

Granted, in the grand scheme of things, they didn’t really happen but they’re still amazing.First up, “Won’t Get Fooled Again”, where Crichton is back on Earth again. Or is he? This time it’s completely different… and just keeps getting crazier and crazier. And we also prove conclusively that the 2000’s line-up of the Guardians of the Galaxy is a complete rip-off (homage?) of Farscape.We wrap up with “The Locket” where the crew gets all timey-wimey inside a misty space bubble. Aeryn and Crichton are stranded on nearby planet that seems to only appear every 55 years while Moya and the rest of the crew never age. How can they all get reunited and back to their normal ages before it’s too late? And our old buddy Stark is back with some dire news for D’Argo.;The Incomparable

They manage to wrap up all the plotlines from the last two episodes in a very satisfying way. And start up a new plotline that will run for many more episodes. Everyone gets a happy ending. Well… almost.Finally, “Beware of Dog” gets a mixed review from both of us. We felt the main plot was a rehash of a couple of different season one episodes. However, we really loved the subplot about Crichton’s continuing interaction with visions of Scorpius that are becoming more and more frequent and intense.;The Incomparable

Crichton can’t catch a break between Aeryn, who can’t commit more to their relationship, a princess to whom Crichton is the only one genetically compatible who needs a husband so her scheming brother doesn’t become ruler, and our old buddy Scorpius who wants to dissect Crichton’s brain. While those relationships are complicated, D’Argo and Chiana’s budding new relationship is getting more intense.In “Part 2: I Do, I Think”, Crichton has no choice but to marry the princess to escape Scorpius. But there’s a downside to married royal life… he and the princess must spend the next 80 cycles as statues. What will the crew do to prevent that? What will all the scheming political envoys do to either prevent the marriage or make it succeed?  Oh, and Zhaan and Pilot meet Moya’s creator.  And it’s not happy that she gave birth to a gunship and proceeds to shut her down, for good.;The Incomparable

Farscape season two is in its groove as Eric and Jason review another two really good episodes (hey, spoilers!)First up, “Out of Their Minds”, where an unfortunate side effect of a strange alien ship’s weapon and Moya’s defense screen causes the crew to switch bodies.  Several times.  We also learn that the DRD’s have more functions than we previously realized.  Oh, and the attacking aliens have programmable vomit.  Yes, you read that correctly.Finally, we review “My Three Crichtons”, where the crew has to deal with the clones of Crichton Past and Crichton Future that some strange ball of energy created.  Which Crichton winds up as the “Last Crichton Standing”?  But where’s Uncle Charley?  Okay, that last one was probably too old a reference to “My Three Sons”, go look that up on Wikipedia kids…;The Incomparable

The crew is starving (what, no more crackers?) and go to a place Chiana used to call home to try to find some more food. Only to get caught up in the local power scheme of keeping people working in the mines to pay for food and protection from the mysterious, deadly creature that roams the mines.Finally, we review “Dream a Little Dream”, where we learn what happened to the rest of the crew after the ending of season one while Aeryn, John and D’Argo were away from Moya. The crew winds up on a planet full of lawyers. And for once, it’s not Chiana or Rygel that you’d think would run afoul of the law… no, it’s Zhaan. Can Chiana and Rygel prove Zhaan’s innocence and get off the planet before Moya leaves?;The Incomparable

Yay! First up, “The Way We Weren’t”, where we finally get the backstory on Pilot and how he came to be bonded to Moya. We also learn that Aeryn was there as well, much to the crew’s shock and anger after seeing her on a previously undiscovered recording. Will they and Pilot forgive her for what she did back then?Finally, we review “Picture If You Will”, where a shopkeeper gifts Chiana with a picture that can seemingly foretell the future. Or can it? Nope, it’s just the crew’s old maniacal super powerful adversary Maldis getting his revenge on them for what they did to him last season. They barely beat him last time with help they no longer have. Can they defeat him this time?;The Incomparable
TeeVee;726;Somebody Hates These Crackers (Farscape S2E03-04);00:45:59;2021-12-29;2021;December;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;Farscape has seemed to hit what can only be described as a “Sophomore Slump” with the first part of season two. But Jason and Eric power through these next episodes as we know better things are to come.First up, “Taking the Stone”, where Chiana is having a rough time and goes to a nearby cemetery planet (yes, you read that right) to clear her head. We learn that Crichton really wants her to come back to Moya, even if he has to do things way out of character to make that happen. And Rygel “borrows” some nice shiny objects from one of the graves on the cemetery planet. Nothing bad ever happens to grave robbers, right?Finally, we review “Crackers Don’t Matter”, where an alien has offered to make Moya undetectable by scans. Which will surely come in handy since Scorpius has left lots of wanted beacons on the planet they just came from where they only had time to buy food crackers… lots and lots of crackers. However, the crew starts acting abnormally when going to the alien’s planet… to the point of insulting, assaulting and even attempting to kill each other. What’s going on? Can they figure it out before it’s too late? And what about all those crackers? Oh right, they don’t matter.;The Incomparable
TeeVee;725;They All Can't Be Winners (Farscape S2E01-02);00:48:03;2021-12-08;2021;December;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;We kick off season two of Farscape with somewhat of a mixed review.  First up, episode one, “Mind the Baby”, where we pick up after the exciting events of the season one finale.  Can the crew be reunited in time before Scorpius finds both Moya and her offspring Talyn?  Can they finally escape this asteroid field?  John and D’Argo get some more bonding time.  And Talyn is being a pain in the neck, literally, for Crais. And then we “discuss” episode two, “Vitas Mortis”.  There are some good “Farscape nuggets” to mine from the episode despite what we thought of the main plot.  Oh well, they all can’t be winners.;The Incomparable
TeeVee;724;Zen and the Art of Disappearing Secondary Characters (Farscape S1E21-22);01:04:39;2021-11-17;2021;November;Tuesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;"After a little bit of a delay, we have way too much fun wrapping up season one of Farscape.  First up, “Bone to Be Wild”, where we discuss where the heck Stark disappeared to after leaving with the crew last episode; how does gravity work on an asteroid; how do Leviathans have their inorganic parts installed; and the fall of Commander Crais and the rise of Scorpius as the big bad for the series.Then we cover the season one finale, “Family Ties”.  Where we discuss where the heck one of the guest stars of the last episode disappeared to after leaving with the Peacekeepers; did Rygel really try to sell out the whole crew to save himself; how planning your big escape plan is shown and not skipped over; and some more great character development and interaction that we’ve come to expect from Farscape.Finally, we recap our thoughts about the entire season… the lowlights and the highlights.  And that even the lowlights have some bits worth watching… not just because we have to for the podcast.Next time, onward to season two!";The Incomparable
TeeVee;723;Fetch the Comfy Chair! (Farscape S1E19-20);00:49:54;2021-10-20;2021;October;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;Farscape delivers its first two-part episode and it does not disappoint!  In the first part, “Nerve”, Aeryn’s still suffering from the wound she received in the last episode.  And the only cure just happens to be on the secret Peacekeeper base nearby.  Crichton and Chiana go there to get it and wind up meeting an old friend, a potential new friend and a new enemy.  The Peacekeeper Scorpius captures Crichton and subjects him to the Aurora Chair, a device that rather painfully extracts your memories.  We leave Crichton trapped in the comfy chair as we end on our first cliffhanger…But we don’t have to wait months for a resolution, no, it’s right on to the next episode, “The Hidden Memory”.  Scorpius learns of Crichton’s feud with Captain Crais and summons him to the secret base. While the crew mount a rescue mission, Moya goes into labor!  But there’s something not right with the baby.  Can the crew rescue Crichton before he breaks in the chair?  What’s up with Moya’s baby?  What will Aeryn do when she finally meets Crais again?  Listen and find out!;The Incomparable
TeeVee;722;One Mippippippi, Two Mippippippi (Farscape S1E17-18);00:51:21;2021-10-06;2021;October;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;Season One is getting closer and closer to being over. In our first episode, “Through the Looking Glass”, Crichton does a lot of running around, through four different Moyas in multiple dimensions due to Moya getting stuck in Starburst.  And apparently they are not alone as something really wants them to leave.  On top of that, each dimension has a different negative effect on the crew.  Can they overcome these strange environments and the lurking presence and get back to normal space?  And what’s with all the food at dinner?  Both times!Finally, we review “A Bug’s Life”. No, not the 1998 Pixar movie — the 1999 Farscape episode with the same name.  Moya welcomes a Peacekeeper Special Ops unit on board whose ship is damaged.  They’re taking their top secret cargo to an also top secret Peacekeeper base hidden in the Uncharted Territories.  So of course, Rygel and Chiana open up the cargo and release the deadly body-possessing, body-hopping virus inside.  It’s a race against time to find out who’s got the virus and neutralize it before it can escape the ship and infect whole worlds!;The Incomparable
TeeVee;721;Head Games (Farscape S1E15-16);00:48:33;2021-09-23;2021;September;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;Eric and Jason cover two really great episodes. First up, “Durka Returns”, where — you guessed it — the Peacekeeper Durka who imprisoned and tortured Rygel for 130 years returns seemingly from the dead. But now he’s a kinder, gentler Durka courtesy of the Nebari and their “mental cleansing”. Or is he? Let’s see how Rygel reacts to this. The Nebari also have a prisoner, Chiana, who doesn’t wish to be cleansed and wants asylum on Moya. Will the crew let her stay?Finally we review “A Human Reaction”. Crichton finds a wormhole back to Earth! But after being gone for seven months, and having translator microbes in his head, and strange technology on his spaceship, he’s not exactly welcomed back with open arms. Things get even worse when the rest of the crew show up unannounced. Can they get away before they’re poked, prodded and dissected by the military? Why does Crichton think everyone he sees in Australia is someone he knows from his past? Is there some unseen force behind all this?;The Incomparable
TeeVee;720;Doctor Crichton, I Presume? (Farscape S1E13-14);00:44:13;2021-09-08;2021;September;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;Eric and Jason continue their rewatch of every episode of Farscape. This means that sometimes you watch some that are good and sometimes some that are not so good.  First up, the mostly not good “The Flax”.  Where Aeryn and John finally reveal their true feelings for one another (the good) and the rest of the crew do things we don’t really care about (the not-so-good).We wrap it up with “Jeremiah Crichton”. We didn’t dislike it as much as the cast and crew apparently did. It’s a mostly good episode where Crichton goes native and where Rygel finally appears to care about other people instead of just looking out for himself.;The Incomparable

Crichton and Aeryn meet a new friend who can repair his ship — for a steep price, while D’Argo meets some not so friendly, and not so bright, bounty hunters.Finally, “Rhapsody in Blue”, where the crew are summoned to a planet with some other Delvian priests like Zhaan. We learn some of Zhaan’s darkest secrets and what some of her people will try to do to throw off Peacekeeper rule.  And our crew has to struggle with what’s real… and what’s not.;The Incomparable
TeeVee;718;What to Expect When a Leviathan's Expecting (Farscape S1E9-10);00:46:44;2021-08-11;2021;August;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;A little bit of a mixed review this time around. First up, “DNA Mad Scientist”, where we like the plotline about the villain and Aeryn and John, but not so much the one with the rest of the crew acting way out of character. But they redeem themselves with the next episode, “They’ve Got a Secret”. Where we learn what D’Argo really was imprisoned for. Plus what a pregnant Leviathan will do to protect her developing baby from any potential threat… meaning Moya’s crew.;The Incomparable

We review two great episodes this time.  First up, “PK Tech Girl”. Earth tech boy meets Sebacean tech girl on a derelict Peacekeeper ship. Romance ensues despite being interrupted by some scavenging explosive reptiles.And we wrap up with “That Old Black Magic”. Thanks to some evil being’s magicks, Crichton gets the chance to finally explain in person that it was an accident that Captain Crais’ brother died way back in episode 1. Things don’t go so well. Can the rest of Moya’s crew save John before it’s too late? And what will it cost some of them?;The Incomparable

More like Groundhog Day, where Crichton relives the same day over and over until he gets it right and saves Moya and her crew.We conclude with “Thank God It’s Friday, Again”.Â  Surprisingly not another Groundhog Day episode given the title. Who’s forcing an entire population to farm Tannot root for them?Â  And what’s someone got to do to have a day off?Â  And which “bug in the navel” idea came first — this episode or the Matrix?;The Incomparable

Up first, “Exodus from Genesis”, where the crew must deal with two invaders, the potentially dangerous Drak and the definitely dangerous Peacekeeper Commandos. Can they get both groups off Moya before Aeryn succumbs to Sebacean Heat Delirium?Then we review “Throne for a Loss”, Farscape’s “very special episode”. The crew must deal with kidnapping, drug addiction and its after effects. Remember kids, just say “no” to space drug injecting gauntlets!;The Incomparable

How does it all fit together? Why should we never trust a hug? And what does Nick Frost have to do with it all?

Instead, we get lots of great scenes with great sets of characters, including Arya and the Hound, Brienne and Podrick, and Tyrion and a succession of visitors. Plus, much more of Sansa and Littlefinger in Crazytown Aerie and a surprise appearance by Westeros’ finest pie maker! We’re not sure if there’s an actual mockingbird, though.(Thanks to listeners for pointing out that the Mockingbird is Littlefinger’s personal crest.);The Incomparable

There are some brief detours to Braavos for Bank Loan Drama and the Dreadfort for Failed Rescue Drama, but it’s Tyrion’s trial that dominates the episode.

That’s right, SPACE is the place, and they’ve invited Leah Petersen along to talk about the stories set there, and the role it plays.Science Fiction’s early depictions of space cast it as a medium to be crossed, or an analog for the sea, facilitating trade, exploration, and empire-building. Frank Herbert made it a commodity, accessible only to those who gave up their humanity. Stephen Baxter filled it with incomprehensible machinations. Star Trek used it as a divide between cultures. Kristine Katherine Rusch riddled it with lethal anomalies. Vernor Vinge gave it dominion over the rise of intelligence. C. J. Cherryh, Samuel Delany, Karen Lord, Alastair Reynolds, Lois McMaster Bujold, and many others shaped the infinite void into a narrative tool.

Stevens;Jeff Patterson";NA;NA;NA;"It is an allegorical tale of interstellar adventure, a quest that is part Moby Dick and part revolutionary act. It is about confluence, archetypes, obsession, seeking the future, and the creative process itself. It is the story that marked the transition from Delany’s more straightforward genre explorations to the maturation of his career when he returned to the field with Dhalgren. It is the book that critic Algis Budrys said “…right now, as of this book…not as of some future book or some accumulated body of work, [Delany] is the best science-fiction writer in the world, at a time when competition for that status is intense.”
In this installment of The Three Hoarsemen, John E. O. Stevens, Fred Kiesche and Jeff Patterson discuss Nova by Samuel R. Delany, including their first encounter with the book, how subsequent readings have altered their views, and the continuing strength of the story after four and a half decades.";The Incomparable

Ink Master Angels goes to Memphis for an episode that’s kind of a downer and kind of uplifting.

For thoughtful discussion of topics, you want to watch RuPaul’s Drag Race. For jerks shouting at each other, you want Ink Master. For people having fun and being happy for each other, you want the finale of Project Runway: All-Stars. For dumb jokes about sex, you want RuPaul’s Drag Race again, because it can be about more than one thing. There was also Ink Master: Angels and Forged in Fire, which continue to be fun, and Glam Masters, which isn’t nearly as good as it should be.;The Incomparable

They also talk about this week’s BIG DRAMA in RuPaul’s Drag Race, the debut of Glam Masters (a makeup application show), Project Runway, Ink Master, and most of the season finale of The Curse of Oak Island. But not all of it, because the recording cut out and they can’t be bothered to find out what happened. Probably not much.;The Incomparable

Which is totally fair, because that trip probably cost some money and you want to squeeze all the juice out of it you can. Speaking of juice, Ink Master used fruit juice to make mosaics that had nothing to do with tattooing but looked like fun. The Amazing Race went to a place made entirely of steep, winding streets because that’s the best way to exhaust the competitors. And Project Runway made some nice dresses. And some not-nice dresses, too.;The Incomparable

The nerve! So after wrapping up Ink Master: Angels and talking briefly about RuPaul’s Drag Race (coming back on January 25) and The Curse of Oak Island (they haven’t found anything) they talk about whatever comes to mind instead. It mostly involves movies.;The Incomparable

And the winner was a nice surprise, which is always…nice? That makes sense. And as the cycle of life is always turning, The Curse of Oak Island is back to its old tricks. Seriously, exactly the same tricks, where they dig holes and don’t find anything. So we spend most of the episode talking about the cast of RuPaul’s Drag Race All-Stars, which is a lot of fun.;The Incomparable

Two episodes of Project Runway, which continues to be very professional! And one episode of American Beauty Star, and we were lucky to make it all the way through it. That is a terrible show. Also, we shared some preliminary thoughts on the Project Runway: All Stars 3 lineup and geeked out about the Templar swords on Forged in Fire.;The Incomparable

Monty and Rhias liked it more than the regular episodes. Halloween Wars is a weird show about a hyper-specific kind of pumpkin carving that somehow has a spinoff series with exactly the same title. And Ink Master: Angels manages to get rid of a lot of the annoying stuff about Ink Master, which was a delightful surprise.;The Incomparable

So Monty and Rhias get to talk about the live season finale of Ink Master and the (not-live) season finale of the Great Food Truck Race. Face Off: Game Face isn’t a season finale, but it’s got four Face Off champions going head-to-head. Face to face? Whatever. And Project Runway also happened!;The Incomparable

That means we cover TWO episodes of Project Runway, in which someone gets home that we wanted to go home, and someone goes home that we didn’t. But both were pretty much justified.Ink Master and the Great Food Truck Race both limped toward the ends of their seasons, so we talked about spin-off shows like the Great Food Truck Rally and Ink Master: Redemption. And Face Off: Game Face had another fun episode of monster and alien makeup.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;29;A Greener Thor;01:09:15;2017-09-14;2017;September;Wednesday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;A Greener Thor;Project Runway goes to the top of the Empire State Building, but it still can’t escape the Twins’ shouting.  Ink Master does what it always does, but at least it involves sending home someone we’re sick of. The Great Food Truck Race has a bad business day in Nashville. And Face Off: Game Face has George! We love George!;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;28;Something With Pecans;00:59:15;2017-09-07;2017;September;Wednesday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Something With Pecans;Project Runway takes inspiration from a new dance movie, but also from pretty much every “fancy dancer meets a hip hop dancer” movie ever. Ink Master packs so many different rounds of challenges into one episode that there’s almost no room left over for people to be jerks to each other. Face Off Game Face continues to be almost too pleasant to talk about, except that we like seeing Rick Baker every week so we’re going to keep talking about it anyway. And the Great Food Truck Race did something with pecans.;The Incomparable

The Great Food Truck Race somehow walks the line of having the most flamboyant, theatrical contestants also be the ones who are most businesslike and no-nonsense. Face Off: Game Face brings back some old favorites who are also current favorites. And Ink Master has some actually good tattoos across the board. Good for them!;The Incomparable

Face Off reaches its season finale just as Game Face arrives to be the short-form version we both deserved and needed. And the Great Food Truck Race is back! It’s possible that you didn’t know it ever existed in the first place, but it did, and it’s a lot of fun for how shameless it is. Ink Master continues its season, and we’re obligated to keep pace even though Project Runway is only one episode in and already has a ton more memorable and identifiable people on it.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;25;Welcome Project Runway;00:50:07;2017-08-17;2017;August;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Welcome Project Runway;Face Off had the first part of its two-part finale, and we got to see what Glenn Hetrick thinks a haunted house should be like. Ink Master continued to do the same stuff it always does by bringing in a jerk no one enjoyed watching the first time. And Project Runway lurched out of the darkness with sixteen new designers to helpfully give us something else to watch, which was nice of it. So we’re watching the new season of that.;The Incomparable

But it was mostly the depressing kind of emotion,so that’s fine. Congratulations to Rachel for choosing between two nearly identical dudes. Monty and Rhias now plan to never touch that franchise again. Meanwhile, Ink Master featured pin-ups that weren’t entirely terrible, Face Off had aliens that claimed to be fun and friendly, and Forged in Fire once again led people down the dangerous path to canister Damascus.;The Incomparable

But that’s not going to stop him from talking about the Bachelorette’s decisions. Which is good, because Rhias is already on the topic. They also cover Face Off, Forged in Fire, Ink Master, and the news about…a Face Off spinoff? A SpinFaceOff?!;The Incomparable

So that’s good news! There’s also Ink Masters to talk about, which had pretty good tattoos to go with its terrible people. That’s kind of the opposite of Face Off, which continues to have nice people even in kind of a down season. Forged in Fire finally let Doug Marcaida straight-up chop the heads off some ballistics-gel dummies. And Monty has some thoughts on Fool Us.But the real news was this ear on Face Off:That’s not where ears go!;The Incomparable

The answer is no. Everyone on Ink Master is a jerk. There’s also Bachelorette, which has mostly trimmed its jerks but also doesn’t have much personality left. And Forged in Fire had people from the SCA that Rhias is pretty sure she’s met.;The Incomparable

RuPaul’s Drag Race had a reunion that was just about drama, then Bachelorette did a worse job than usual of not being gross. Ink Master was what it always is, and even Face Off wasn’t as much fun as usual. So Monty and Rhias got distracted and talked about the season finales of Fargo and American Gods. And also the series finale of The Sopranos. You’ve watched everything that’s ever been aired, right?;The Incomparable

RuPaul’s Drag Race continued to delight. Forged in Fire chopped up some ballistics-gel dummies, which you’d think would get old but actually never does. The Amazing Race had its second-least-deserving winner ever. And Ink Master returned for a new season of tattoo artists shouting at each other about stuff.;The Incomparable

Well, the swords looked kind of clumsy, but they were made by cool people. And sometimes that’s enough. RuPaul’s Drag Race had the most shocking lip-sync ever! For real this time!

Except now it’s on purpose, so it’s okay. Face Off reached the semi-finals with four great competitors and made them make gargoyles. Cosplay Melee did superheroes and revealed the secret feud between fabric and foam. And Forged in Fire chopped another pig in half.

RuPaul’s Drag Race is just starting its season, so we don’t know if that’s happening yet. We had to make do with Lady Gaga being an amazing guest judge, and two of our three preseason favorites being in the top three.

It’s another great two-parter, in which we see our crew used as playthings for the Hirogen, whose only purpose is to hunt. Janeway is a French Underground leader, Seven is a torch singer, and Neelix is a badass Klingon, thanks to the holodeck. But we reserve our highest praise for Harry Kim, who had to heroically manage the ship and outwit the Hirogen. That guy deserves a promotion.;The Incomparable

We were six months into the pandemic, and Year of Hell really struck home for both of us.

They do have prefab housing, scientific equipment, a replicator and other tech, but only each other (and one inconvenient monkey) for company.

She’s a fan of B’Elanna Torres and The Doctor, so we chose Revulsion (S4E5) for our homework.The story of the lonely hologram, stranded on a ship by himself, is one of the best Voyager episodes, with Torres and The Doctor forming an away team to help repair both the ship and the holographic matrix. But something is wrong, which leads to a tense and fascinating story. Guest star Leland Orser is one of the best in the Voyager series, with a creepy performance as the “isomorph” Dejaren, who resists The Doctor’s optimistic attitude towards humans.This episode is also known for Seven of Nine’s matter-of-fact rebuff of Harry Kim’s attempts to woo her as they begin work on the new astrometrics lab, and if you are a fan of Tom + B’Elanna, there’s a key moment in their newly-acknowledged attraction for each other.;The Incomparable

For this episode, we watch “Nightingale” (S7E8), in which Harry gets his chance to take over as captain of a alien medical ship under fire.

We watched a non-random episode, chosen by Scott, called “Blink Of An Eye” (S6E12), and discussed what makes it a good episode of Star Trek generally and Voyager specifically.;The Incomparable
