We dig deep into love and communication while making wild speculations about what could come next for John and Jane if we get a season 2. ;The Incomparable
Agents of SMOOCH;114;Full of Wild Notions;01:16:30;2024-03-15;2024;March;Friday;Annette Wierstra;Kirsten Goruk;NA;The Buccaneers;For today’s mission, our Agents take on The Buccaneers, an Apple TV series that is scandal-laden and somewhat historical. The modern sensibility and soundtrack laid over the historical invasion of rich American debutants into cash-strapped British upper-class society make for an energetic vibe. If you missed it, our Agents recommend catching up before joining us for a good gossip about the collection of characters. In lieu of research, these Agents have chosen to go for wild historical speculations. Warning! The Director permitted Agent Kirsten to swear and she took advantage so this episode is NSFW. ;The Incomparable

We are starting with the 2005 movie that shows Great Truths Hidden Under the Fantastical. On the surface, this is a movie about two married spies flirting by trying to kill each other. Underneath the fantasy, this movie is about the safety of expressing your feelings and true self to your partner. Grab your hidden stash of weapons, it’s about to get dangerous-metaphorically. Don’t blow up your house, Agents. This mission includes a bit of a discussion about the Mr. & Mrs. Smith TV show, but we hold on to those thoughts until Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Part 2) comes to a mission near you soon.;The Incomparable

We have Dennis Quaid practicing the art of seduction with Ellen Barkin amid a murder investigation. With a seedy 80s vibe, they follow a trail of clues that lead them deeper into a corrupt mess in New Orleans. The investigation keeps pulling them apart making us wonder: Will they or won’t they? ;The Incomparable

And what better way to celebrate than with the Christmas action movie Long Kiss Goodnight with Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson?

Ghosted matches up Chris Evans and Ana de Armas again in a spy/not a spy action adventure. We don’t recommend it as a stalkering road map for finding love IRL, but it is full of chases, OTT villains, and a plot that takes us across the globe. If you want a fun escape with pretty people in nice clothes chasing MacGuffins, this movie is about as deep as you need it to be.;The Incomparable

This is a movie our agents know by heart but they are coming back to after a long period of absence. Does this change our perspective of the classic romantic adventure? We dive right in with a focus on the romance between Princess Buttercup and her Wesley. Is it a great epic romance? They also consider how this story might shift if anyone dared to give it a modern reboot (inconceivable!) or a sequel (looking at you Willow). Drop. Your. Sword.

This episode is full of spoilers but our Agents spend little time talking about the plot. We do talk about character arcs and relationship development.

In any event, the 2022 Easter Special of Doctor Who has arrived. Pirates! Sea Devils! Plot machinations! Interpersonal relationship… developments? It’s the last stop before the final episode of the Chibnall/Whitaker era, and we’ll spend a lot of time wondering (again) how today’s Doctor Who might not be like tomorrow’s Doctor Who.;The Incomparable

We give our quick reactions to this year’s festive “Doctor Who” special, which features time loops and Daleks and comic relief and a little bit of set-up for the remainder of the Chibnall era.

Doctor Who Flashcast;68;"""The Vanquishers"" (S13E6)";01:11:31;2021-12-06;2021;December;Sunday;Jason Snell;"Erika Ensign;Annette Wierstra";NA;NA;The “Flux” season reaches its end. Erika Ensign enjoyed the ride, Annette Wierstra is in the middle, and Jason’s frustrated by all the loose ends. We try to break down an episode jam-packed with plot points, lore, spaceships, and cinematic wipes.;The Incomparable
Doctor Who Flashcast;67;"""Survivors of the Flux"" (S13E5)";01:21:02;2021-11-28;2021;November;Sunday;Jason Snell;Lizbeth Myles;NA;NA;Verity! podcaster and Big Finish writer Lizbeth Myles joins Jason to discuss “Survivors of the Flux,” the penultimate episode of this short, interlinked season. This is an episode that has to do a lot of work setting up for the grand finale, and one-third of the story has to do all that heavy lifting—but with an intriguing emotional aspect to things. What worked? Did we spot all the references? What’s in store for next week? And more broadly, how are we feeling about the Chibnall Masterplan?;The Incomparable

More broadly, Houman Sadri and Antony Johnston join Jason to discuss how the season is shaping up, where the show may be going from here, and at the end, some particularly wild fan theories—and Jason even invents one of his own.;The Incomparable

Also, Yaz meets Vinder at a temple populated by floating triangles, and Dan takes a wok on the wild side. (No?) We also offer some theories about where “Flux” may be going, some of which may be somewhat too reliant on our ridiculously detailed knowledge of “Doctor Who” history.;The Incomparable

As is so often true for multi-part Doctor Who adventures, it’s actually hard to judge how it went from a single episode! But we try our best to identify all the dangling threads in episode one, from men in hats to a surprisingly un-chilly Arctic Circle to a tiny house that puts one in the mind of The Master even if he’s not anywhere to be found! Also, we discuss if this sort of storytelling is what “Doctor Who” in a modern context should look like.;The Incomparable

Lions, Towers & Shields;84;The Healthy Habits of Hat Check Girls;00:56:17;2023-11-02;2023;November;Thursday;Shelly Brisbin;"Judy Samelson;Randy Dotinga;Micheline Maynard;Nathan Alderman";NA;In A Lonely Place;Nicholas Ray directs Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Graham. Bogie is Dix Steele, who should not be confused for Captain Picard’s hollowdeck alter ego, Dixon Hill. (Am I the only one who does that?)  Bogie is not a detective, but a screenwriter suspected of murder. In A Lonely Place is considered one of the best film noir made, and Bogart and Graham give excellent performances.;The Incomparable
Lions, Towers & Shields;83;The Original Sin is Littering;00:50:58;2023-10-26;2023;October;Thursday;Nathan Alderman;"Shelly Brisbin;Annette Wierstra;Randy Dotinga";NA;Cat People;It’s the age-old story: Boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl get married, girl’s psychosexual hangups put strain on their marriage, girl may or may not begin turning into a large murderous panther because of an ancient family curse … you know, the usual. Horror auteur Val Lewton and ace director Jacques Tourneur spin a low budget into shadow-drenched, spine-tingling gold in a creepy classic that takes the time to care about its characters, and brilliantly lets sound, suggestion, and your imagination do all the heavy lifting. Featuring the most infamous bus in movie history! (Note: This is the 1940s original, not the, er, sweaty 1980s remake.) With your guest host, Nathan Alderman.;The Incomparable

Noir, melodrama, dark humor, horror. It’s all here in this classic, staring Gloria Swanson. She’s all of 46 when she made this movie, but a has-been like her character. This episode is full of excellent trivia and unexpected connections made by our super-smart panel.;The Incomparable

That would be Preston Sturges. A soldier is discharged from the Army because he has hay fever, but is declared a war hero when he returns to his hometown. Eddie Bracken and Ella Raines (last seen on LTS in Phantom Lady) are your stars.;The Incomparable

Loehr;Randy Dotinga;Nathan Alderman;Dr. Drang";NA;To Be Or Not To Be;The Lubitsch Touch applied to Nazi occupation? You bet. Carole Lombard and Jack Benny star as members of an acting troupe in Poland, scrambling after the Nazis arrive. It’s funny and serious all at once, with great performances. The film was released two months after Lombard died in a plane crash, and would have earned good will, had the subject matter not been a rough go for Americans of the time.;The Incomparable

The cast is trapped together in a Florida hotel, awaiting a hurricane. It’s a film noir, so there are secrets and gun play, plus the eventual storm to contend with. And a boat.;The Incomparable

We’ve only talked about Sirk in the context of “Lured,” a movie I think is underrated, but one that looks nothing like this splashy 50s melodrama. This one stars Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson. And I get to talk about Agnes Moorehead. So, bonus! Can a lonely widow find love with a tree farmer? Stay tuned. We also mention Todd Haynes’ excellent 2002 remake (you read that right!), “Far from Heaven” with Julianne Moore.;The Incomparable

It’s a story about two people with a mutual obsession with guns, but it’s told with sensitivity and a focus on their relationship.;The Incomparable

She’s teamed with Robert Walker, who’s a soldier on leave when they meet in New York City. It’s a little bit Affair to Remember, and a little bit On the Town. Really sweet, well-acted romantic film. Directed by Garland’s soon-to-be husband Vincente Minnelli.;The Incomparable

Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn star in the far better of their two dramatic pairings. Be warned, we talk about politics, both old and new. And, um, Texas history?;The Incomparable
Lions, Towers & Shields;62;Shelly's Own String of Murders;00:56:15;2022-10-20;2022;October;Thursday;Nathan Alderman;"Shelly Brisbin;Randy Dotinga";NA;Dead of Night;Britain’s Ealing Studios is best known for its comedies, including The Ladykillers, The Lavender Hill Mob, and Kind Hearts And Coronets. But this 1945 precursor to those famously funny films deals more with chills than chuckles. Four directors tag-team to adapt a mix of original and classic tales, including one based on a story by H.G. Wells. It’s the rare horror anthology whose framing story is as creepily compelling as its individual tales of terror, building to a memorably hair-raising climax that’ll stick with you through the closing credits and beyond. Come for the golf-induced suicide, stay for the ventriloquist’s dummy.;The Incomparable

Great performances from Fredric March, Dana Andrews, Teresa Wright, Myrna Loy and acting newcomer Harold Russell. Lesser-known faves of mine, Gladys George and Cathy O’Donnell are also great to see. Released a year after war’s end, this is the winner of many awards. Wyler served in the war, and I think it shows in the way he made this film.**;The Incomparable

Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson and Ann Miller are your stars, and a very young Bob Fosse is among the standouts in the cast. Movie censors got to Porter’s lyrics, which gives us some fun topics to cover. It’s also your host’s birthday show. Because it’s too darn hot to cover anything else.;The Incomparable

Winchell was a powerful, vindictive dude, and Lancaster is deliciously evil here, going after the man his sister loves, because he can. Tony Curtis co-stars as a man doing Lancaster’s bidding to advance his own career. The film is based on Ernest Lehman’s novel, and the screenplay was co-written by Clifford Odets. The script is a strong point, as are Lancaster and Curtis’s  performances. Enjoy the great jazz score, and get lost in the sleazy world of press agents and corrupt columnists. ;The Incomparable

Here’s a noir melodrama with its share of flaws that I like, regardless. And man, IMDB gives a LOT more plot than I would have. “A pregnant woman adopts the identity of a railroad crash victim and starts a new life with the woman’s wealthy in-laws, but is soon blackmailed by her devious ex.” It’s stylishly directed by Mitchell Leisen, and features lots of familiar character actors. And John Lund is also in it.;The Incomparable

Gregory Peck is early in his film career, and Ingrid Bergman is all, see you later, Charles Boyer. That’s a “Gaslight” joke. Also notable for the Salvador Dali dream sequence.;The Incomparable

And also on George McCreedy and Glenn Ford. It’s a love triangle and an erotic noir. But many people just focus on Rita Hayworth’s song and the dress she sang it in. Gilda also features plenty of gay subtext, which we’ll discuss at length, as well as why some films of this era “got away” with gay themes, while others did not. I also believe we’re setting a record for references to past LTS episodes. I’m not mad at that.;The Incomparable

Loehr";NA;Silk Stockings;By the late 1950s, big-budget musicals were in color and wide screen, and MGM made several really great ones. Late-period Cole Porter wrote the songs, and Fred Astaire is paired with a much younger partner (surprise!), Cyd Charisse in this remake of 1939’s Ninotchka - Garbo’s last great film. For extra credit, watch both. Enjoy the comedy stylings of Peter Lorre and his commissars, and the delightful Janice Paige, too.;The Incomparable

Loehr;Nathan Alderman";NA;Bringing Up Baby;This is episode #50, so it’s special! And Baby is one of my favorite movies of all time. Howard Hawks directs Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and a sweet little kitty! It’s a screwball comedy, and Hepburn as a comedienne is a revelation. If you hate it, you might not want to join, because unlike many other episodes, where I encourage dissent, I will fight you on this one. You should also know that I can quote way too many lines.;The Incomparable

Let’s meet in six months at the top of the Empire State Building. In 1939, Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne had a date. In 1957, it was Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. In each movie, something keeps the lovers from meeting up as planned. And though it was a dumb thing (according to me) the movies remain classics of the romance genre.;The Incomparable

You may know him from 20,000 Leagues under the Sea and (spoiler alert) Soylent Green is people! In The Narrow Margin, a cop must protect a woman scheduled to testify against a killer. Much of the action takes place on a cross-country train, in which the visual margins are indeed narrow.;The Incomparable

Charles Boyer needs to drive Ingrid Bergman crazy so he can steal her jewels - a crime he first tried to commit against Ingrid’s aunt, years before. George Cukor takes an unusual turn at dark, noirish storytelling, and Bergman wins an Oscar. Joseph Cotten costars, and Angela Lansbury makes her film debut at age 19. Host’s note: Gaslight may be triggering for someone who has experienced an abusive relationship. And that may be surprising information about a black-and-white film from 1944. We encourage you to approach the film itself carefully if depictions of manipulation in relationships might be uncomfortable for you. ;The Incomparable

Jeanne Crain, Linda Darnell and Ann Sothern are your stars, along with the unrelated Douglases, Kirk and Paul. A letter written to three women by their “bad friend” pretty much freaks everyone out, and it’s most definitely a female-centered story, well-directed by Joe Mankiewicz. Go figure. ;The Incomparable

Sam Fuller’s 1953 “Pickup on South Street” is well-directed, and especially well-acted by Thelma Ritter, Richard Widmark and character actor Murvyn Vye - but you can call him Tiger. There’s a crackerjack score, and a reasonably suspenseful plot, too, and the cinematography is inventive and compelling.;The Incomparable

No, Marlene Dietrich and Herbert Marshall? Marlene and a cute little kid? Marlene in the Deep South? This movie will surprise you. IT is part of the cycle of films she made with Josef von Sternberg during her early American career. And our heroine goes through A LOT. I’d argue it’s among Dietrich’s most sympathetic roles.

She was the queen of the Warner lot when she wasn’t fighting with her bosses, and she played her share of scenery-chewing roles as both a young woman and an older one. But All This and Heaven Too is not one of these. The Davis we meet here is deep in melodrama, certainly, but her performance is controlled and quiet. She loves Charles Boyer, and he loves her, but nothing’s going right for them. Behold, LTS does romance!;The Incomparable

Well, provided you’ve got ready cash on hand, and you don’t ask too many questions… Horror auteur Val Lewton and still-rookie director Robert Wise adapt Robert Louis Stevenson’s short story with typically eerie elegance — but you’ll come away remembering Boris Karloff, in maybe the greatest performance of his career, as a deceptively cheerful cabman with a grisly side hustle. A much-diminished Bela Lugosi’s also in it, barely — but the key scene he shares with Karloff will stick with you long after you’ve seen this relatively little-known and underrated classic. ;The Incomparable

For an episode that we didn’t like, we try to find positive things where we can. And we muse about how introducing Michelle in season 2 might have pulled the rug out from under all of Magnum’s future romance ambitions.Keep those emails coming to magnum@theincomparable.com and we’ll see you next year!;The Incomparable

It’s more complicated than that, as the show unfortunately handles gender identity issues. Tyne Daly appears as a grizzled journalist, who commits many acts of journalist malpractice!

Neither John nor your regular hosts had ever seen Scarface. We fixed that.Of course, Siracusa’s known for being hypercritical.

We took a few weeks off, but then we felt that longing, that need to once again share the joy of watching a movie most everyone has seen, but that at least one of us hasn’t.In this case, Dan introduced Lex to 1992’s Sneakers, which Lex repeatedly attempted to confuse with the Angelina Jolie starrer Hackers. Sneakers is not Hackers, as Dan patiently explained to Lex. Repeatedly. For a movie about cryptography and hacking, Sneakers holds up surprisingly well.Hot topics include Lex’s confusion between Robert Redford and Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley’s New Jersey accent or lack thereof, and stock characters.Support the show by watching Sneakers via Amazon streaming, or by grabbing the movie from iTunes.

And that man, of course, is Connery. Sean Connery.This week, Dan invites Lex to see a movie for the first time—a movie where Connery gets precisely such a role: 1990’s The Hunt for Red October. Lex had been in the theater for this film once, years ago, but he fell asleep after just a few minutes.That doesn’t happen this time. Or does it?!Hot topics include unsubtle language transitions, submarine lingo, and whatever the word is for that narrative device where you know more, and also less, than the other characters do. (It’s probably German.)Support Not Playing by streaming The Hunt For Red October from Amazon or iTunes. And while you’re there, go ahead and leave us a review, won’t you, tovarisch? ;The Incomparable

But perhaps no pair of brothers has become so famous for an extended masturbation joke as the brothers Farrelly.Dan had never seen their, ahem, seminal 1998 classic There’s Something About Mary. After learning of Dan’s appreciation for the comedy in movies like Army of Darkness and Hudson Hawk, Lex felt like he had a good chance of entertaining Dan with Stiller/Diaz/Dillon hijinks.You’ll have to listen to learn whether Lex was right. Hot topics include stunt dogs, the brothers Dillon, and cringeworthy comedy. You can watch along with us by streaming the film from Amazon or iTunes.

And that project is the 1991 box-office bomb—but cult classic!—Hudson Hawk. Lex, like much of America, hadn’t seen it. And, at Dan’s insistence, Lex did no research of any kind; he had no idea what to expect as he watched it with Dan for the first time. In retrospect, Lex thinks maybe he should have been drunk. At least as drunk as Willis himself must have been when he conceived the film.Hot topics include whether this is David Caruso’s best role, the perfection of a certain runaway stretcher scene, and how stupid is too stupid for comedy.";The Incomparable

Confidential, that’s what.Dan knew Lex had never seen the Russell Crowe/Kim Basinger/Guy Pearce/Kevin Spacey/Danny DeVito flick. He also knew that the movie won Oscars (though it lost many more to Titanic), and, of course, that L.A. Confidential has a 99% fresh rating over at Rotten Tomatoes.

Or, maybe an acquaintance who helped you that one time? Casey asks himself this same question as he considers re-editing an interview to make the guest look not terrible. Meanwhile Dan can’t seem to say the name “Kafelnikov”, and we roll our eyes at a very throwaway subplot about Natalie disagreeing with the pope.

Instead we have a silly subplot about a “Who’s cooler, Dan or Casey” online poll and way too much time spent dwelling on undergarments. This may sound like a bit of a mess, but not to worry, Lex and Brian are here to help you Sorkin’ in It (and they’re both wearing underwear).;The Incomparable

Dune. Desert Planet. But maybe not the one you’re thinking of. In our own very peculiar way we honor David Lynch by discussing the feature film he probably liked the least, 1984’s “Dune.” Sting with a knife! Patrick Stewart riding a sandworm! How does it all compare with the modern version? Does it have its own special lower-budget charms? (Don’t mention the voiceovers…) What about the voiceovers?

Guillermo Del Toro’s “Pan’s Labyrinth” toggles effortless between bizarre, Miyazaki-like fantasy (inverted toads!) and an all-too-real tale of violence and treachery in fascist Spain. It’s dark, beautiful, full of disgusting bugs, and manages to use Del Toro muse Doug Jones as not one but two separate monsters! ;The Incomparable

Come back with us to look at his run on Animal Man, issues 1-26, in which a has-been/never-was superhero becomes an outspoken animal rights activist, witnesses the near-undoing of the Crisis on Infinite Earths, and meets his own maker—who looks strangely like Grant Morrison.

It’s time for the bland future of 2015, the apocalyptic alt-present of 1985, and a familiar 1955. But most of all, it’s time for a Crisis on Infinite Biffs.

Or at least that’s who we’d be in our version of the HBO Max miniseries, “Station Eleven.” We discuss the moving, optimistic post-apocalyptic tale that is told in a fractured time sequence and features lots of Shakespeare and a suspiciously powerful self-published graphic novel. And though there’s definitely no “Station Twelve” on the horizon, we can’t help but imagine what other stories are there just waiting to never be told.;The Incomparable

Video game club is back in session to discuss “Little Nightmares II”, the creepy prequel to the beloved spooky platformer, Little Nightmares. We play as Mono, a bag-faced boy, as he and his companion navigate a world of puzzles and monsters lurking in the dark, only to be led to his own nightmare.;The Incomparable

Talk about range! Our Book Club reconvenes to discuss the fantasy mystery “Witness for the Dead,” a standalone book set in the world of “The Goblin Emperor”, and “A Desolation Called Peace,” the conclusion of the duology begun in the award-winning “A Memory Called Empire.” Plus: What are we reading?;The Incomparable

What happens when you give him his own show? “The Book of Boba Fett” is the answer—or is it? After all, parts of this show are really episodes of a different, arguably better show. Our panel discusses the seven-episode season and tries to figure out if this mess is hot or cold.;The Incomparable

For our purposes, we’re designating the “decade” as 2010-2019. Along the way, we may ponder the most important question a reader should ask: Are there Zeppelins?;The Incomparable

Kate Bishop! Yelena! Echo! Surprise cameos, including one by an owl! It’s a TV series nobody watching “The Avengers” would have ever wanted, yet a worn and exasperated Jeremy Renner as the mentor to a young woman with strong archery skills ends up being a delightful holiday adventure.;The Incomparable

It’s “Spider-Man: Endgame,” and with great podcasts, there must also come great responsibility… to talk about Spider-Man.;The Incomparable

We discuss the first season with the help of our resident Wheel of Time book expert and three non-book-readers. How much is or isn’t it the “next Game of Thrones?” Why would it need to be be? And how does a book series that was wildly progressive for the 1990s approach a modern audience?;The Incomparable

Toast, vests, London Bobbies sucking on their chin straps, Debbie the receptionist, Paul as “second boss”, Yoko’s knitting, George Harrison’s pinstripes, and most importantly, the amazing view of a bunch of musical geniuses having a very difficult time creating anything at all.;The Incomparable

We discuss what worked this season and what didn’t, anticipate the 2022 run of specials to end Jodie Whitaker’s era, and ponder what Modern Doctor Who looks like when Russell T Davies takes over the show (again) in 2023.;The Incomparable

It’s full of interesting choices, some of which pay off, while others end up amounting to not very much. ;The Incomparable

Loehr";The Incomparable Mothership;“Last Action Hero”;We’ve gathered the family around the table to celebrate F’sgiving, a thing we just made up in which we care enough to watch a film featuring F. Murray Abraham. In this case it’s “Last Action Hero,” a movie that Wikipedia claims is a cult classic. We don’t know about that, but it certainly is unjustly maligned. This is a big, loud action movie that is also a parody and celebration of big, loud action movies. Sure, it’s got its flaws—we’re looking at you, kid—but there’s a whole lot to like.;The Incomparable

We’re venturing out into the uncharted deserts of Arrakis with “Dune,” Denis Villeneuve’s cinematic take on the oft-filmed Frank Herbert novel. We do some comparing and contrasting with David Lynch’s version, question whether this adaptation is for fans for for people who know nothing about “Dune”, and basically stare at a bunch of big spaceships hanging in the air. Denis Villeneuve knows what we like. ;The Incomparable

This is an amazing show with a fantastic cast about a bunch of geeks and burnouts in Michigan in the early 1980s. It’s a sweet and funny and awkward and painful story about growing up and trying to figure out who you are, while everyone else in the world wants to label you and make sure you never forget your label. We discuss our favorite ancillary characters, the richness of the world of “Freaks and Geeks”, and how upon rewatching the show 20 years later, we have gained even more appreciation for Mr. and Mrs. Weir.;The Incomparable

We view the Hitchcock classic “Rear Window” and visit the smelly, greasy, fuzzy ’70s film for “The Conversation.” Also, we call back to the Summer of Spielberg with a discussion of how Francis Ford Coppola’s career making art films like “The Conversation” was derailed by fantastic commercial success.;The Incomparable

First it’s the news that Russell T Davies, who brought “Doctor Who” back in 2005, is reuniting with his producers from that era to produce and write the show. Then came the announcement that J. Michael Straczynski has been contracted with The CW to write a pilot for a rebooted “Babylon 5.” Can you go home again? Will they play the hits or strike out in new directions? Just a reminder, nobody is going to delete your favorite old episodes—not even the BBC.;The Incomparable

Not only be it days from the equinox, but it be International Talk Like a Pirate Day. What better time to wrap up the Summer of Spielberg with “Hook,” a (misguided?) Peter Pan sequel starring Robin Williams as Peter, Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, and Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, all gallivanting around a very crowded and overlit stage-set version of Neverland. We discuss the movie’s appeal to early-nineties kids, Spielberg’s commercial sensibility as a director, and the film’s many misguided creative decisions.;The Incomparable

We’ve taken out our surgical tools to diagnose just what went wrong with “Ready Player One,” in which a director who is much more interested in movies than video games and who himself deeply influenced 80s culture is put in charge of a too-faithful adaptation of a book about video games and 80s culture. We spent a lot of our time imagining a much better movie that could have been made instead of this one.;The Incomparable

We cover 2005’s “War of the Worlds,” starring Tom Cruise as a dad who just wants to protect his kids from the end of the world. Well, maybe one of his kids. Screaming! Explosions! Implausible plot points! Not enough Miranda Otto! Maybe too much Tim Robbins! The 9/11 influence is strong in this one.;The Incomparable

The Summer of Spielberg continues with 2002’s “Minority Report,” a sci-fi noirish murder mystery combined with a vision of the future and a dose of social commentary. We discuss the future’s retinal-scanning obsession, Tom Cruise’s security eyes, and the amazing precog named Agatha. Is it now? I’m tired of the future. ;The Incomparable

Artificial Intelligence”;The Summer of Spielberg turns its eyes to “A.I. Artificial Intelligence,” a project begun by Stanley Kubrick and completed by Steven Spielberg. Whether it works for you may hinge entirely on if you consider it a science-fiction story or a fairy tale. We marvel at some great performances, are frustrated by some creative choices, and in the end find ourselves applauding the boldness of the ending. (Now pass us some tissues, we’re ugly crying.);The Incomparable

Unfortunately, we also watched the Spielberg-directed cash-grab sequel, “The Lost World: Jurassic Park.”;The Incomparable

Along the way we talk about the “Doctor Who” references, the deep-cut comics references, the mighty Richard E. Grant, and the spectacular look and sounds of this outstanding series. ;The Incomparable

(And some of us didn’t.) This is a movie delayed from pre-COVID times, it’s the first Marvel movie in the Disney+ era, and it’s set during 2016’s “Captain America: Civil War”—conveniently before the main character dies. With all that, it’s also a film that puts its title heroine at the center of a “Mission: Impossible” style story that’s also, strangely, about a couple of particularly messed-up families.;The Incomparable

While not officially part of the Cornetto Trilogy, this British alien-invasion film shares a lot of DNA with those movies, and it’s about as close an analog to “Shaun of the Dead” as you’ll find—but with the comedy dial turned down a bit. It features career-making performances by John Boyega and Jodie Whittaker, who went on to become the faces of famous sci-fi franchises. And after the last 10 years, some of the social commentary in this film hits home more than ever. Allow it! ;The Incomparable

In part two of our three-part survey of novels shortlisted for 2021’s top SF and Fantasy awards, we’re discussing the magic and romance of “The Midnight Bargain” by C.L.

Before the Spoiler Horn, we’ll tell you why this show is worth watching—and warn you about how it mixes its love of brightly colored superhero imagery and storylines with logical but unrestrained violence and gore. Then we break down some of this adaptation’s interesting story choices and ponder where it might be headed in season two and three. ;The Incomparable

Loehr";The Incomparable Mothership;NA;We know there are a lot of superhero movies out there. Sometimes it seems like there are so many, it’s as if a random-number generator just assigned pieces of intellectual property to film directors. But where some might despair at this situation, we looked at it as an opportunity to harness the terrible power of the random-number generator and use our own creativity to assign the right directors to the right comic-book film projects. Now listen to our choices and try to tell us that any currently in-production films are any less ridiculous.;The Incomparable

It’s 2010’s “Megamind,” which transcends being an extrusion from the Dreamworks animation factory (well, except for its pop-music soundtrack) to become something greater. With an all-star cast led by Will Ferrell and Tina Fey, this is a great riff on the Superman mythos and the true meaning of destiny and heroism. Code: It’s great.;The Incomparable

Marvel’s second Disney+ series, “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” picks up the story of two of Captain America’s pals as they confront serious societal issues, the representation of America in the modern age, and a gaggle of super-powered foes. It’s a show that takes some big swings, even if it does get a bit muddled, and we discuss its ambitions, what it gets right, and where it misses the mark.;The Incomparable

Does it matter that the main characters are generic, or does it actually help? Is this a slasher film or more of a smasher film? Why did it kick off a nonsensical franchise of unrelated movies?

So we gather back together to consider why we’re drawn to Hayao Miyazaki’s work, how we define the differences between films as different as “Ponyo” and “Spirited Away,” a list of the director’s favorite things, subs versus dubs, the music of Joe Hisaishi, and which of Miyazaki’s movies we all prefer. ;The Incomparable

It’s time to discuss 1981 South African karate movie “Kill and Kill Again,” a film featuring many middle-aged men kicking people, as well as a James Bond-style plot about a madman who wants to take over the world via an unusual application of potatoes. We cover strange ties to “CSI: Miami” and “The A-Team,” introduce you to the wonders of Hot Dog and his bag of tricks, weigh the movie’s knowing sexism against its unflinching racism, and contemplate Villanous Operations and how they are named. Also, Jason has a tight five about t-shirts. ;The Incomparable

An ecological disaster leads to the breakup of an enemy empire, but in “Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country” it’s the Klingon moon Praxis subbing in for the Soviet power station Chernobyl. Kirk and company struggle with their animosity toward the Klingons, but we are more concerned with what graduate school Gorkon’s daughter went to, the Klingon guard who carries a box, the one Klingon who laughed at McCoy’s joke, the importance of gaseous anomalies to Federation politics, and the lack of respect given to the Enterprise court reporter. Discussing this movie must’ve been our lifelong ambition.;The Incomparable

This episode is Phil’s revenge, as we watch two acclaimed early-80s films and see how well they hold up. They’re both period pieces, but one is set to the electronic sounds of Vangelis and the other to the classical masterpieces of Mozart. Running in slow motion has never looked better, and there’s never been more braying laughter in a film! ;The Incomparable

We discuss the play, the unpleasant Franco Zeffirelli 1967 film starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, the film and TV versions of Cole Porter’s “Kiss Me, Kate,” the teen rom-com “10 Things I Hate About You,” and even the 1980s TV adaptation on “Moonlighting,” which might be the best of the bunch?

It’s “What We Do in the Shadows,” a show that honors vampire lore while placing them in ridiculous mundane situations. A mockumentary sitcom featuring vampires might seem like an entry from TV Mad Libs, but this show (based on an indie feature film also by Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi) uses its stellar cast and sharp writing to create a bizarre world of energy vampires, complaining familiars, new-age witches, and—the horror—local politics. ;The Incomparable

We break down the character arcs for Dolores, Bernard, Dolores, Maeve, Dolores, Serac, and Dolores.

Is movie tuberculosis like real tuberculosis? Is Miyazaki’s approach to pre-war Japan (and its allies, Germany and Italy) delicate or problematic? Does the film sufficiently address whether creators are complicit in how their work is used? Is the wind still rising?;The Incomparable

They’re set in an alternate timeline where the Space Race we know happened quite a bit differently, and at the center is the world-famous Lady Astronaut, Elma York.

A year before “The Matrix” there was another film about identity and memory and the meaning of reality, cloaked in noir tropes and gunfire and mind-blowing revelations. It’s 1998’s “Dark City”, directed by Alex Proyas and starring Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connelly, William Hurt, and a heavy-breathing Kiefer Sutherland.

Nope! It’s a fun film with romance, snappy ironic dialogue, and a stunning cast. And it’s also a fascinating historical document, given that it was written before Pearl Harbor and produced in the early days of America’s involvement in World War II, when the end of the war was anything but a foregone conclusion. We discuss the magical letters of transit, Captain Renault’s jocular amorality, Victor Laszlo the speechifying drip, Ilsa’s piercing stare, Major Strasser’s favorite cereal, Sam’s implausible piano handwork, the Ken Cinema in San Diego, and how the war was like a rap battle.;The Incomparable

Our brave panelists watch 2000’s “Dungeons & Dragons”, which features dungeons, dragons, a horribly unbalanced party, an infuriating lack of connection to the game, a set of polar-opposite performances by Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch, a six-foot-tall “dwarf”, political theater even more boring than The Phantom Menace, generous garnishes of racism and sexism, and a villain who wears blue lipstick. Oh, and did we mention that TV’s Doctor Who is in it as an exposition elf? Join us as we watch until the end and finally say, “Ugh, WTF?” ;The Incomparable

Every choice you make and every fact you uncover could completely change the story… or more likely, change the details a little bit.

The show’s second season recently completed on American screens, so we’ve gathered to discuss the latest developments. It’s a unique mixing of big ideas and domestic life, but does the second season suffer from the show’s reluctance to make major changes at the end of season one? What made this season so frustrating, so often? Which storylines worked—and which ones were missed opportunities? Why does Carrie Anne Moss keep talking to blades of grass stored on a server? Why would any human want to be a Synth? What’s Mark Zuckerberg doing here? We cover it all.;The Incomparable

Based on a series of books by Lev Grossman, this is a show that starts out as a mash-up of Harry Potter and Narnia and goes in some very surprising directions while continually improving in quality. Love, war, sex, fairies, gods (some evil, some capricious, some just annoying)—there’s a lot to love about this show. In the first half of the episode we talk generally about the show and why we like it; the second half, after the Spoiler Horn, is devoted to breaking down the events of its just-completed second season.(Content advisory: “The Magicians” contains a couple examples of sexual assault/abuse.

This isn’t another superhero comic adaptation, but something unlike anything we’ve seen before—a visual and auditory feast, great actors, and smart writing that will make sure you sit up and pay attention. If you’ve written off comic-book TV shows and movies, time to circle back and appreciate this eight-episode first season from writer/producer Noah Hawley (“Fargo”). Expensive music! Beautiful sets!

We discuss the film’s interesting color palette, the weight of a full paint can, the water-resisting qualities of Bruce Willis’s green poncho, why anyone would like the colors rust and brown, and the practicality of Samuel L.

In this installment, we travel across the pond for a panel predominantly made up of residents of the UK. Why are there Scottish people in space? Who is the face of fresh young fascism?

What spoilers have we avoided? (This episode certainly contains none.) What does it mean that “Star Wars” is now an extended film franchise releasing new films annually? How many times are we going to see the film next weekend, and how will we find time to podcast about it? And perhaps most importantly, can any new “Star Wars” movie ever possibly hope to capture the excitement we felt when we discovered these films as children?;The Incomparable

Abrams “Star Trek” movies) and a lack of specifics (they’re still interviewing writers and didn’t announce even the most basic of premises). Our panel of Star Trek fans analyzes the interesting decisions CBS has made so far, tries to imagine how a “Star Trek” series from 2017 might differ from its predecessors, and discusses the importance of creating a series that can keep the franchise alive by appealing to a new generation of fans.;The Incomparable

We discuss “WarGames,” the 1983 John Badham film starring Matthew Broderick, Dabney Coleman, and Ally Sheedy. Is this the ultimate film for computer nerds like us? How do the film’s Cold War themes contrast with its anti-technology themes? Can a computer make moral decisions? Why is there so much nerd shaming and sexism? And why do they let tour buses into the heart of America’s nuclear command? So many questions, Professor Falken, and so few remote-controlled pterodactyls.;The Incomparable

It’s a book that’s far more complex than its elevator-pitch premise would suggest, but did our panel appreciate its winking narrative-within-narrative structure?

We also talk about Bacigalupi’s particular brand of eco-apocalypse, his use of science fiction to make us reconsider what’s going on today in the world, and how to pronounce his name.

We discuss Joss Whedon’s Marvel movie, which has been a hit with audiences and critics. But some members of our panel don’t agree. How much do expectations factor in to one’s enjoyment of a movie? Has the bar for summer action blockbusters been set too low by the likes of “Transformers 2”? Should every action-adventure movie aspire to be something more?

Also, how is Luke’s journey to being a Jedi not like what you see in most action movies? Who is more heroic in the end, Luke or Vader? Why does the Emperor wait so long to show us his lightning fingers? Why are rebel ships equipped with fireworks? And is Endor the name of the moon, or the name of the planet the moon is orbiting, or both?;The Incomparable

Akers joins us to talk about Murder Under Glass, an episode from the final season of the original NBC run of Columbo featuring Louis Jourdan as a food critic and, of course, a murderer. It is maybe not the most perfect episode, but well worth a visit for the variations on the formula—people are actually happy to see the good Lieutenant for once, and he gets to show off some serious culinary skills.We also get to talking about Will’s own mystery novels. Somehow, we wind up talking about Mack Bolan, the Executioner, of all things. And role playing games. And baseball. Oh, and there’s a little touch of film noir right at the start…;The Incomparable

Loehr;Shannon Sudderth";NA;Mystery series we initially enjoyed and then gave up on;We’ve all started reading down mystery series or authors, and then hit a point where we said, “nah, I’m good.” In this episode, we talk about what we gave up on and why, and some we loved all throughout. This comes from a place of love: we enjoyed early installments enough that we kept reading, but something eventually got lost for us. In fact, we often recommend the first few or even several novels, and tell you when the best point to stop is —Â the subtitle of this episode is “exactly when to stop reading.”An important note: this episode was accidentally recorded with macabre timing. The first author we discuss on this show, Sue Grafton, passed away while we were recording the episode — that same evening. We obviously didn’t know while recording, and found out the next morning. Thus, we speak about her as a current writer. We’ve edited the episode to remove some discussion about the planned final novel in her series, Z, which her family says wasn’t written and which they won’t hire someone else to write.Some Afoot news: we haven’t been able to get enough panelists together for regular tapings, so we’re going on hiatus.

The two films have a lot in common, including Robert Moore as director, Peter Falk as the Bogie analog, and Madeline Kahn in a wonderful supporting role in each. But the Afoot panel prefers one to the other. Which one?

Nearly every episode of the long-running TV character (across two series and 69 episodes) showed viewers the murder at its start. Columbo, a police detective, is brought in on the case, and we see the killer becoming increasingly agitated as he relentlessly circles his prey.

It appeared in a few film festivals and then had a limited release in Spain, so it’s kind of a miracle that Rhias ever got her hands on this third-generation VHS copy. Anyway, it’s kind of a spaghetti western noir in a postapocalyptic setting, made in Spain, and Iggy Pop is in it.;The Incomparable

Where the crew accidentally go back in time and try to set right what they messed up by trying to make sure they didn’t mess history up. But this isn’t your typical time travel episode where things all turn out the same or better in the end. Afterall, this is Farscape we’re talking about.Finally the really dark episode, “Eat Me”. Farscape’s survival horror episode. Where the crew fend off cannibalistic pseudo-zombies and a mad scientist on a diseased and dying Leviathan. And where the ending leaves the crew seeing double… double Crichtons.;The Incomparable

And it’s not a happy, fun time for our wayward crew.First up — “Self-Inflicted Wounds (Part 1): Could’a, Would’a, Should’a”. While on their way to a planet that can help Zhaan heal, Moya runs across a wormhole. Before anyone can do anything, a ship comes out of it and materializes part way inside Moya. The crews of both ships work on ways to separate themselves, but it seems the aliens on the other ship have ulterior motives. And we meet our newest crewmember - Jool.Finally in “Self-Inflicted Wounds (Part 2): Wait for the Wheel”, we learn that the aliens are sabotaging Moya so their ship can be the only one to escape the wormhole. Our crew must put their differences of opinions and desires aside to save them all before the aliens’ plans are realized. And one of our crew makes the ultimate sacrifice.;The Incomparable

They jump into the beginning of season three — which now has new opening theme music, “new” cast members and a new narration.First up, the exciting conclusion to the end of season two, “Season of Death”. That’s the name of the episode, not the name of the last season… Does Aeryn come back to life? Does Crichton get his head back together, both literally and psychologically? Does Rygel really like what Chiana’s cooking?Then we wrap up with “Suns and Lovers”. Where we hopefully put the whole D’Argo / Chiana / Jothee love triangle behind us, never to be spoken of again. And not just because the crew is trapped on a disabled space station about to be destroyed by a mysterious wave of energy soon approaching. Can they find the source of the signal attracting the wave in time? Can they saved the trapped children and themselves? And can Aeryn and Crichton finally find some “alone time”?;The Incomparable

Instead of using their newly obtained mercenaries to rescue D’Argo’s son, now they’re off to rescue Crichton from Scorpius’ clutches. But don’t worry, Stark has another foolproof plan… ah, frell that, it’s time for a guns blazing, frontal assault! They manage to rescue Crichton, but at what cost?Finally, “Die Me, Dichotomy”, the (mostly) exciting season two cliffhanger. The crew locates a healer who can both heal Moya and get the neural chip out of Crichton’s head. But the chip isn’t having any of that and does its best to get itself, and Crichton, back to Scorpius. And then some other things happen that we’d like to forget about, before the exciting cliffhanger ending that sets up season three.;The Incomparable

And during all that, wander off on tangents about Star Wars, the A-Team and past episodes of this here podcast.First up, “Part 1 - A Not So Simple Plan”. Which is pretty much as advertised. Stark (hey, isn’t he dead?) has a not so simple plan to steal enough money to buy D’Argo’s son Jothee from the slavers holding him captive.  With such a complicated plan, it goes off without any issues at all.  No… who are we kidding?  Of course not.  The crew must deal with a heavily secured depository, its leader, and our old buddy Scorpius to get what they need.Finally, “Part 2 - With Friends Like These…”.  After learning that all their efforts last time weren’t quite good enough, this time it’s Crichton who comes up with his own somewhat simpler plan to free Jothee.  But it involves recruiting several people we met in season one who they didn’t leave on the best of terms with.  It goes better than you’d expect, but there’s yet another complication that might make their hard work all for naught.  And Crichton has to make a hard choice…;The Incomparable

But things don’t go according to plan and the crew has to recount, from each of their perspectives, what went wrong or else face summary execution.Finally, “A Clockwork Nebari”, where Chiana learns some truths, some ugly, some not-so-ugly, about her people and her brother. Meanwhile the crew is mentally cleansed by the aforementioned Nebari and have to snap out of it if they’re going to get away.  It’s like totally bitchin’, man. Far out.;The Incomparable

Granted, in the grand scheme of things, they didn’t really happen but they’re still amazing.First up, “Won’t Get Fooled Again”, where Crichton is back on Earth again. Or is he? This time it’s completely different… and just keeps getting crazier and crazier. And we also prove conclusively that the 2000’s line-up of the Guardians of the Galaxy is a complete rip-off (homage?) of Farscape.We wrap up with “The Locket” where the crew gets all timey-wimey inside a misty space bubble. Aeryn and Crichton are stranded on nearby planet that seems to only appear every 55 years while Moya and the rest of the crew never age. How can they all get reunited and back to their normal ages before it’s too late? And our old buddy Stark is back with some dire news for D’Argo.;The Incomparable

They manage to wrap up all the plotlines from the last two episodes in a very satisfying way. And start up a new plotline that will run for many more episodes. Everyone gets a happy ending. Well… almost.Finally, “Beware of Dog” gets a mixed review from both of us. We felt the main plot was a rehash of a couple of different season one episodes. However, we really loved the subplot about Crichton’s continuing interaction with visions of Scorpius that are becoming more and more frequent and intense.;The Incomparable

Crichton can’t catch a break between Aeryn, who can’t commit more to their relationship, a princess to whom Crichton is the only one genetically compatible who needs a husband so her scheming brother doesn’t become ruler, and our old buddy Scorpius who wants to dissect Crichton’s brain. While those relationships are complicated, D’Argo and Chiana’s budding new relationship is getting more intense.In “Part 2: I Do, I Think”, Crichton has no choice but to marry the princess to escape Scorpius. But there’s a downside to married royal life… he and the princess must spend the next 80 cycles as statues. What will the crew do to prevent that? What will all the scheming political envoys do to either prevent the marriage or make it succeed?  Oh, and Zhaan and Pilot meet Moya’s creator.  And it’s not happy that she gave birth to a gunship and proceeds to shut her down, for good.;The Incomparable

Farscape season two is in its groove as Eric and Jason review another two really good episodes (hey, spoilers!)First up, “Out of Their Minds”, where an unfortunate side effect of a strange alien ship’s weapon and Moya’s defense screen causes the crew to switch bodies.  Several times.  We also learn that the DRD’s have more functions than we previously realized.  Oh, and the attacking aliens have programmable vomit.  Yes, you read that correctly.Finally, we review “My Three Crichtons”, where the crew has to deal with the clones of Crichton Past and Crichton Future that some strange ball of energy created.  Which Crichton winds up as the “Last Crichton Standing”?  But where’s Uncle Charley?  Okay, that last one was probably too old a reference to “My Three Sons”, go look that up on Wikipedia kids…;The Incomparable

The crew is starving (what, no more crackers?) and go to a place Chiana used to call home to try to find some more food. Only to get caught up in the local power scheme of keeping people working in the mines to pay for food and protection from the mysterious, deadly creature that roams the mines.Finally, we review “Dream a Little Dream”, where we learn what happened to the rest of the crew after the ending of season one while Aeryn, John and D’Argo were away from Moya. The crew winds up on a planet full of lawyers. And for once, it’s not Chiana or Rygel that you’d think would run afoul of the law… no, it’s Zhaan.

Yay! First up, “The Way We Weren’t”, where we finally get the backstory on Pilot and how he came to be bonded to Moya. We also learn that Aeryn was there as well, much to the crew’s shock and anger after seeing her on a previously undiscovered recording. Will they and Pilot forgive her for what she did back then?Finally, we review “Picture If You Will”, where a shopkeeper gifts Chiana with a picture that can seemingly foretell the future. Or can it? Nope, it’s just the crew’s old maniacal super powerful adversary Maldis getting his revenge on them for what they did to him last season. They barely beat him last time with help they no longer have.

But Jason and Eric power through these next episodes as we know better things are to come.First up, “Taking the Stone”, where Chiana is having a rough time and goes to a nearby cemetery planet (yes, you read that right) to clear her head. We learn that Crichton really wants her to come back to Moya, even if he has to do things way out of character to make that happen. And Rygel “borrows” some nice shiny objects from one of the graves on the cemetery planet. Nothing bad ever happens to grave robbers, right?Finally, we review “Crackers Don’t Matter”, where an alien has offered to make Moya undetectable by scans. Which will surely come in handy since Scorpius has left lots of wanted beacons on the planet they just came from where they only had time to buy food crackers… lots and lots of crackers. However, the crew starts acting abnormally when going to the alien’s planet… to the point of insulting, assaulting and even attempting to kill each other. What’s going on? Can they figure it out before it’s too late? And what about all those crackers? Oh right, they don’t matter.;The Incomparable

First up, episode one, “Mind the Baby”, where we pick up after the exciting events of the season one finale.  Can the crew be reunited in time before Scorpius finds both Moya and her offspring Talyn?  Can they finally escape this asteroid field?  John and D’Argo get some more bonding time.  And Talyn is being a pain in the neck, literally, for Crais. And then we “discuss” episode two, “Vitas Mortis”.

Where we discuss where the heck one of the guest stars of the last episode disappeared to after leaving with the Peacekeepers; did Rygel really try to sell out the whole crew to save himself; how planning your big escape plan is shown and not skipped over; and some more great character development and interaction that we’ve come to expect from Farscape.Finally, we recap our thoughts about the entire season… the lowlights and the highlights.

In the first part, “Nerve”, Aeryn’s still suffering from the wound she received in the last episode.  And the only cure just happens to be on the secret Peacekeeper base nearby.  Crichton and Chiana go there to get it and wind up meeting an old friend, a potential new friend and a new enemy.  The Peacekeeper Scorpius captures Crichton and subjects him to the Aurora Chair, a device that rather painfully extracts your memories.  We leave Crichton trapped in the comfy chair as we end on our first cliffhanger…But we don’t have to wait months for a resolution, no, it’s right on to the next episode, “The Hidden Memory”.  Scorpius learns of Crichton’s feud with Captain Crais and summons him to the secret base. While the crew mount a rescue mission, Moya goes into labor!  But there’s something not right with the baby.  Can the crew rescue Crichton before he breaks in the chair?  What’s up with Moya’s baby?  What will Aeryn do when she finally meets Crais again?  Listen and find out!;The Incomparable

In our first episode, “Through the Looking Glass”, Crichton does a lot of running around, through four different Moyas in multiple dimensions due to Moya getting stuck in Starburst.  And apparently they are not alone as something really wants them to leave.  On top of that, each dimension has a different negative effect on the crew.  Can they overcome these strange environments and the lurking presence and get back to normal space?  And what’s with all the food at dinner?  Both times!Finally, we review “A Bug’s Life”. No, not the 1998 Pixar movie — the 1999 Farscape episode with the same name.  Moya welcomes a Peacekeeper Special Ops unit on board whose ship is damaged.  They’re taking their top secret cargo to an also top secret Peacekeeper base hidden in the Uncharted Territories.  So of course, Rygel and Chiana open up the cargo and release the deadly body-possessing, body-hopping virus inside.  It’s a race against time to find out who’s got the virus and neutralize it before it can escape the ship and infect whole worlds!;The Incomparable
TeeVee;721;Head Games (Farscape S1E15-16);00:48:33;2021-09-23;2021;September;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;Eric and Jason cover two really great episodes. First up, “Durka Returns”, where — you guessed it — the Peacekeeper Durka who imprisoned and tortured Rygel for 130 years returns seemingly from the dead. But now he’s a kinder, gentler Durka courtesy of the Nebari and their “mental cleansing”. Or is he? Let’s see how Rygel reacts to this. The Nebari also have a prisoner, Chiana, who doesn’t wish to be cleansed and wants asylum on Moya. Will the crew let her stay?Finally we review “A Human Reaction”. Crichton finds a wormhole back to Earth! But after being gone for seven months, and having translator microbes in his head, and strange technology on his spaceship, he’s not exactly welcomed back with open arms. Things get even worse when the rest of the crew show up unannounced. Can they get away before they’re poked, prodded and dissected by the military? Why does Crichton think everyone he sees in Australia is someone he knows from his past? Is there some unseen force behind all this?;The Incomparable
TeeVee;720;Doctor Crichton, I Presume? (Farscape S1E13-14);00:44:13;2021-09-08;2021;September;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;Eric and Jason continue their rewatch of every episode of Farscape. This means that sometimes you watch some that are good and sometimes some that are not so good.  First up, the mostly not good “The Flax”.  Where Aeryn and John finally reveal their true feelings for one another (the good) and the rest of the crew do things we don’t really care about (the not-so-good).We wrap it up with “Jeremiah Crichton”. We didn’t dislike it as much as the cast and crew apparently did. It’s a mostly good episode where Crichton goes native and where Rygel finally appears to care about other people instead of just looking out for himself.;The Incomparable
TeeVee;719;Evil Blue Man Group (Farscape S1E11-12);00:54:12;2021-08-25;2021;August;Wednesday;"Jason Johnson;Eric Scott";NA;Farscape;NA;In “Till the Blood Runs Clear”, Crichton finally manages to recreate a wormhole, but it isn’t stable. Crichton and Aeryn meet a new friend who can repair his ship — for a steep price, while D’Argo meets some not so friendly, and not so bright, bounty hunters.Finally, “Rhapsody in Blue”, where the crew are summoned to a planet with some other Delvian priests like Zhaan. We learn some of Zhaan’s darkest secrets and what some of her people will try to do to throw off Peacekeeper rule.  And our crew has to struggle with what’s real… and what’s not.;The Incomparable
TeeVee;718;What to Expect When a Leviathan's Expecting (Farscape S1E9-10);00:46:44;2021-08-11;2021;August;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;A little bit of a mixed review this time around. First up, “DNA Mad Scientist”, where we like the plotline about the villain and Aeryn and John, but not so much the one with the rest of the crew acting way out of character. But they redeem themselves with the next episode, “They’ve Got a Secret”. Where we learn what D’Argo really was imprisoned for. Plus what a pregnant Leviathan will do to protect her developing baby from any potential threat… meaning Moya’s crew.;The Incomparable
TeeVee;717;Reach Out and Touch Someone (Farscape S1E7-8);00:46:26;2021-07-28;2021;July;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;We’re a third of the way through season one and already Farscape has hit its stride. We review two great episodes this time.  First up, “PK Tech Girl”. Earth tech boy meets Sebacean tech girl on a derelict Peacekeeper ship. Romance ensues despite being interrupted by some scavenging explosive reptiles.And we wrap up with “That Old Black Magic”. Thanks to some evil being’s magicks, Crichton gets the chance to finally explain in person that it was an accident that Captain Crais’ brother died way back in episode 1. Things don’t go so well. Can the rest of Moya’s crew save John before it’s too late? And what will it cost some of them?;The Incomparable
TeeVee;716;Time Loops and Roots (Farscape S1E5-6);00:45:14;2021-07-15;2021;July;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;Next up in our Farscape rewatch — “Back and Back and Back to the Future”.Â  Surprisingly not all three movies about a kid and his time travelling DeLorean. More like Groundhog Day, where Crichton relives the same day over and over until he gets it right and saves Moya and her crew.We conclude with “Thank God It’s Friday, Again”.Â  Surprisingly not another Groundhog Day episode given the title. Who’s forcing an entire population to farm Tannot root for them?Â  And what’s someone got to do to have a day off?Â  And which “bug in the navel” idea came first — this episode or the Matrix?;The Incomparable
TeeVee;715;Space Roach Motel (Farscape S1E3-4);00:44:40;2021-06-30;2021;June;Wednesday;"Eric Scott;Jason Johnson";NA;Farscape;NA;We continue our rewatch of Farscape season one.  Up first, “Exodus from Genesis”, where the crew must deal with two invaders, the potentially dangerous Drak and the definitely dangerous Peacekeeper Commandos. Can they get both groups off Moya before Aeryn succumbs to Sebacean Heat Delirium?Then we review “Throne for a Loss”, Farscape’s “very special episode”. The crew must deal with kidnapping, drug addiction and its after effects. Remember kids, just say “no” to space drug injecting gauntlets!;The Incomparable

In this finale we got a lot of technical and plot stuff that doesn’t survive a whole lot of logic, but the emotional and character beats are truthful and the season’s overarching themes (Doctor as commander of soldiers, “Am I a good man?”, Clara as Doctor-in-training, and the lies—oh, all the lies) are brought home strongly. How does it all fit together? Why should we never trust a hug? And what does Nick Frost have to do with it all?

Stevens, Fred Kiesche and Jeff Patterson turn their thoughts to the cold, merciless abyss that engulfs us all. That’s right, SPACE is the place, and they’ve invited Leah Petersen along to talk about the stories set there, and the role it plays.Science Fiction’s early depictions of space cast it as a medium to be crossed, or an analog for the sea, facilitating trade, exploration, and empire-building. Frank Herbert made it a commodity, accessible only to those who gave up their humanity. Stephen Baxter filled it with incomprehensible machinations. Star Trek used it as a divide between cultures. Kristine Katherine Rusch riddled it with lethal anomalies. Vernor Vinge gave it dominion over the rise of intelligence. C. J. Cherryh, Samuel Delany, Karen Lord, Alastair Reynolds, Lois McMaster Bujold, and many others shaped the infinite void into a narrative tool. Now, with Star Wars,The Expanse, and a possible new ninth planet, space is once again imposing itself on popular culture. Is it up to the challenge?As always, the discussion turns to recent culture consumed.;The Incomparable

The Villain Edit;54;Hot and Smoky;00:31:50;2018-08-23;2018;August;Wednesday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;NA;Rhias and Monty take a break from complaining about the air quality in Seattle to talk about the delightfully questionable television they’ve been watching, including Making It, Nailed It, The Great Food Truck Race, and the webseries Camp Wannakiki, which is the latest entry in the surprisingly robust genre of drag queen reality shows.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;53;Making It Is Fun;00:41:55;2018-08-03;2018;August;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Making It Is Fun;There’s this new competitive crafting show called Making It, hosted by Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman. It’s gotten a lot of media coverage because it’s on a real network and it’s hosted by legit TV stars, but it also falls firmly within the purview of The Villain Edit. Monty and Rhias also talk about the brand new season of The Great Food Truck Race, which is as silly as it’s always been, and the (sob) impending series finale of Face Off.;The Incomparable

And they have some opinions! So many opinions, in fact, that some spill over into their discussion of Face Off and Forged in Fire. And they also reminisce about that one show where people had to dress up window displays for department stores, but competitively. That was weird.;The Incomparable

It’s a great show that’s fun to watch! They also talk about Forged in Fire before weighing in on the current state of RuPaul’ss Drag Race, and make fun of something called “Truck Night in America” based on Monty having half-watched a commercial for it once.

And also because those are bad shows that they don’t want to watch anymore. And they say hello to two new shows: Forged in Fire: Knife or Death and the Great Interior Design Challenge, which have different challenges as shows. They also continue to say hello to Ink Master: Angels and Forged in Fire, which are both good shows. And then they catch up on RuPaul’s Drag Race! So much to talk about!;The Incomparable

Ink Master Angels goes to Memphis for an episode that’s kind of a downer and kind of uplifting. And RuPaul’s Drag Race serves 33 separate runway looks, because it turns out that looking good in a dress is kind of a big part of being a drag queen.;The Incomparable

For thoughtful discussion of topics, you want to watch RuPaul’s Drag Race. For jerks shouting at each other, you want Ink Master. For people having fun and being happy for each other, you want the finale of Project Runway: All-Stars. For dumb jokes about sex, you want RuPaul’s Drag Race again, because it can be about more than one thing. There was also Ink Master: Angels and Forged in Fire, which continue to be fun, and Glam Masters, which isn’t nearly as good as it should be.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;45;Flaming Swords Are Realistic;00:34:19;2018-03-30;2018;March;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Flaming Swords Are Realistic;Monty and Rhias are in favor of Ink Master Angels over Ink Master, and Forged in Fire over Project Runway, and also RuPaul’s Drag Race over just about everything. This is even though Monty’s Fantasy Drag Race Team is already in shambles, forcing an immediate reconsideration of everything.;The Incomparable

Monty was going to mention it, but forgot. So he’s using it here, because it’s such a weird phrase. There’s also talk about Ink Masters, Forged in Fire, and Project Runway: All-Stars, before they get down to the important business of dissecting the finale of RuPaul’s All-Star Drag Race Season 3.;The Incomparable

They also talk about this week’s BIG DRAMA in RuPaul’s Drag Race, the debut of Glam Masters (a makeup application show), Project Runway, Ink Master, and most of the season finale of The Curse of Oak Island. But not all of it, because the recording cut out and they can’t be bothered to find out what happened. Probably not much.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;41;Crunchy Frog;00:40:41;2018-02-26;2018;February;Sunday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Crunchy Frog;Two weeks of Drag Race means a lot of stuff happened. Two weeks of The Amazing Race means even more happened, because those were two-hour episodes. Two weeks of Project Runway All-Stars means only the regular amount happened because they were off for a week. And two weeks of The Curse of Oak Island means that nothing happened, just like with any amount of The Curse of Oak Island.;The Incomparable

The Amazing Race goes to Zimbabwe and gets some wild animals to come pretty close to its contestants. Ink Master has no idea what “pixelated” means. And RuPaul’s Drag Race rips The Bachelor to shreds using the ancient art of…improv?;The Incomparable

But the real news is that Rhias has discovered Dragula, and she has introduced Monty to it, and it’s disgusting and great.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;38;I've Seen That Shape Before;00:36:32;2018-01-21;2018;January;Saturday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;I’ve Seen That Shape Before;On Oak Island, the new game is apparently to bring up the trip to the Templar prison at the drop of a hat. Which is totally fair, because that trip probably cost some money and you want to squeeze all the juice out of it you can. Speaking of juice, Ink Master used fruit juice to make mosaics that had nothing to do with tattooing but looked like fun. The Amazing Race went to a place made entirely of steep, winding streets because that’s the best way to exhaust the competitors. And Project Runway made some nice dresses. And some not-nice dresses, too.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;37;Totes Dyslex;00:47:11;2018-01-13;2018;January;Friday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Totes Dyslex;All the reality shows are back! Well, probably not absolutely all of them. But The Amazing Race, Ink Master, and Project Runway have all made their 2017 debuts, and the Curse of Oak Island continues to do…whatever it is that show does. Monty and Rhias are here to catch you (and each other) up. There’s also a special bonus update on My Big Fat Fabulous Life, which has some drama you will want to hear about.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;36;Going Off-Topic;00:29:52;2017-12-15;2017;December;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Going Off-Topic;Monty and Rhias momentarily ran out of interesting shows to talk about, because apparently television is too busy showing good shows instead. The nerve! So after wrapping up Ink Master: Angels and talking briefly about RuPaul’s Drag Race (coming back on January 25) and The Curse of Oak Island (they haven’t found anything) they talk about whatever comes to mind instead. It mostly involves movies.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;35;Drag Race All-Star Rundown;00:43:27;2017-11-19;2017;November;Saturday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Drag Race All-Star Rundown;Project Runway reached its finale, which kind of took forever. And the winner was a nice surprise, which is always…nice? That makes sense. And as the cycle of life is always turning, The Curse of Oak Island is back to its old tricks. Seriously, exactly the same tricks, where they dig holes and don’t find anything. So we spend most of the episode talking about the cast of RuPaul’s Drag Race All-Stars, which is a lot of fun.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;34;Another Win For Poopy Pants;00:38:48;2017-10-27;2017;October;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Another Win For Poopy Pants;Two episodes of Ink Master: Angels, which is proving to be a pretty fun show! Two episodes of Project Runway, which continues to be very professional! And one episode of American Beauty Star, and we were lucky to make it all the way through it. That is a terrible show. Also, we shared some preliminary thoughts on the Project Runway: All Stars 3 lineup and geeked out about the Templar swords on Forged in Fire.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;33;Dumpster Fire at the Fabric Store;00:40:12;2017-10-13;2017;October;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Dumpster Fire at the Fabric Store;Two episodes of Project Runway contain a total of three eliminations. And another elimination that gets rescinded. Ink Master Angels goes to the biggest cowboy bar in the world, I think. And Halloween Wars…just isn’t very good.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;32;The Tragic Wigs;00:53:45;2017-10-05;2017;October;Wednesday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;The Tragic Wigs;Face Off: Game Face ends with a weird episode that was intended as the pilot before they made some changes. Monty and Rhias liked it more than the regular episodes. Halloween Wars is a weird show about a hyper-specific kind of pumpkin carving that somehow has a spinoff series with exactly the same title. And Ink Master: Angels manages to get rid of a lot of the annoying stuff about Ink Master, which was a delightful surprise.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;31;Season Finale Week;01:01:48;2017-09-29;2017;September;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Season Finale Week;The return of real television means that some of these garbage shows have to wrap things up. So Monty and Rhias get to talk about the live season finale of Ink Master and the (not-live) season finale of the Great Food Truck Race. Face Off: Game Face isn’t a season finale, but it’s got four Face Off champions going head-to-head. Face to face? Whatever. And Project Runway also happened!;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;30;Acetone on a Bald Cap;00:50:40;2017-09-25;2017;September;Sunday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Acetone on a Bald Cap;We are late, but we exist! That means we cover TWO episodes of Project Runway, in which someone gets home that we wanted to go home, and someone goes home that we didn’t. But both were pretty much justified.Ink Master and the Great Food Truck Race both limped toward the ends of their seasons, so we talked about spin-off shows like the Great Food Truck Rally and Ink Master: Redemption. And Face Off: Game Face had another fun episode of monster and alien makeup.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;29;A Greener Thor;01:09:15;2017-09-14;2017;September;Wednesday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;A Greener Thor;Project Runway goes to the top of the Empire State Building, but it still can’t escape the Twins’ shouting.  Ink Master does what it always does, but at least it involves sending home someone we’re sick of. The Great Food Truck Race has a bad business day in Nashville. And Face Off: Game Face has George! We love George!;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;28;Something With Pecans;00:59:15;2017-09-07;2017;September;Wednesday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Something With Pecans;Project Runway takes inspiration from a new dance movie, but also from pretty much every “fancy dancer meets a hip hop dancer” movie ever. Ink Master packs so many different rounds of challenges into one episode that there’s almost no room left over for people to be jerks to each other. Face Off Game Face continues to be almost too pleasant to talk about, except that we like seeing Rick Baker every week so we’re going to keep talking about it anyway. And the Great Food Truck Race did something with pecans.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;27;Game Face Truck Race;00:59:12;2017-08-31;2017;August;Wednesday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Game Face Truck Race;Project Runway has an unconventional materials team challenge with the entirely conventional result of making one of the designers melt down. The Great Food Truck Race somehow walks the line of having the most flamboyant, theatrical contestants also be the ones who are most businesslike and no-nonsense. Face Off: Game Face brings back some old favorites who are also current favorites. And Ink Master has some actually good tattoos across the board. Good for them!;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;26;Klaus Nomi in a Space Bag;00:54:27;2017-08-25;2017;August;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Klaus Nomi in a Space Bag;So many shows! Face Off reaches its season finale just as Game Face arrives to be the short-form version we both deserved and needed. And the Great Food Truck Race is back! It’s possible that you didn’t know it ever existed in the first place, but it did, and it’s a lot of fun for how shameless it is. Ink Master continues its season, and we’re obligated to keep pace even though Project Runway is only one episode in and already has a ton more memorable and identifiable people on it.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;25;Welcome Project Runway;00:50:07;2017-08-17;2017;August;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Welcome Project Runway;Face Off had the first part of its two-part finale, and we got to see what Glenn Hetrick thinks a haunted house should be like. Ink Master continued to do the same stuff it always does by bringing in a jerk no one enjoyed watching the first time. And Project Runway lurched out of the darkness with sixteen new designers to helpfully give us something else to watch, which was nice of it. So we’re watching the new season of that.;The Incomparable

But it was mostly the depressing kind of emotion,so that’s fine. Congratulations to Rachel for choosing between two nearly identical dudes. Monty and Rhias now plan to never touch that franchise again. Meanwhile, Ink Master featured pin-ups that weren’t entirely terrible, Face Off had aliens that claimed to be fun and friendly, and Forged in Fire once again led people down the dangerous path to canister Damascus.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;23;The Men Bore All;00:38:22;2017-08-04;2017;August;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;The Men Bore All;On The Bachelorette, the men told all, but Monty and Rhias weren’t really listening. It was more fun to talk about bad tattoos on Ink Master, bad makeup on Face Off, and even bad knives on Forged in Fire.;The Incomparable

But that’s not going to stop him from talking about the Bachelorette’s decisions. Which is good, because Rhias is already on the topic. They also cover Face Off, Forged in Fire, Ink Master, and the news about…a Face Off spinoff? A SpinFaceOff?!;The Incomparable

So that’s good news! There’s also Ink Masters to talk about, which had pretty good tattoos to go with its terrible people. That’s kind of the opposite of Face Off, which continues to have nice people even in kind of a down season. Forged in Fire finally let Doug Marcaida straight-up chop the heads off some ballistics-gel dummies. And Monty has some thoughts on Fool Us.But the real news was this ear on Face Off:That’s not where ears go!;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;20;Jelly Roll Technique;00:47:10;2017-07-14;2017;July;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;Ink Master vs. Face Off;Monty and Rhias tackle the classic question: could the contestants on Ink Master ever actually be better than the ones on Face Off? The answer is no. Everyone on Ink Master is a jerk. There’s also Bachelorette, which has mostly trimmed its jerks but also doesn’t have much personality left. And Forged in Fire had people from the SCA that Rhias is pretty sure she’s met.;The Incomparable
The Villain Edit;19;Contains Fargo Spoilers, For Some Reason;00:48:42;2017-06-23;2017;June;Thursday;"Monty Ashley;Rhias Hall";NA;NA;A rough week of reality shows, but a good week of scripted television;Kind of a downer week of reality shows, huh? RuPaul’s Drag Race had a reunion that was just about drama, then Bachelorette did a worse job than usual of not being gross. Ink Master was what it always is, and even Face Off wasn’t as much fun as usual. So Monty and Rhias got distracted and talked about the season finales of Fargo and American Gods. And also the series finale of The Sopranos. You’ve watched everything that’s ever been aired, right?;The Incomparable

RuPaul’s Drag Race continued to delight. Forged in Fire chopped up some ballistics-gel dummies, which you’d think would get old but actually never does. The Amazing Race had its second-least-deserving winner ever. And Ink Master returned for a new season of tattoo artists shouting at each other about stuff.;The Incomparable

Well, the swords looked kind of clumsy, but they were made by cool people. And sometimes that’s enough. RuPaul’s Drag Race had the most shocking lip-sync ever! For real this time!

Except now it’s on purpose, so it’s okay. Face Off reached the semi-finals with four great competitors and made them make gargoyles. Cosplay Melee did superheroes and revealed the secret feud between fabric and foam. And Forged in Fire chopped another pig in half. Do you think they have a barbecue when they’re done?;The Incomparable

Cosplay Melee enters the world of video games, some of which Monty’s played. Face Off takes a trip to the islands for a Dole Whip. RuPaul’s Drag Race has pretty, pretty princesses. And Monty takes time out to lecture Gordon Ramsay about what he’s doing wrong.;The Incomparable

Face Off did an alien senate, although we don’t remember a lot of subcommittees being discussed. RuPaul’s Drag Race brought back an old favorite and said a goodbye that was equal parts sad and inevitable. We also talked briefly about this season’s gimmick on The Amazing Race.;The Incomparable

RuPaul’s Drag Race is just starting its season, so we don’t know if that’s happening yet. We had to make do with Lady Gaga being an amazing guest judge, and two of our three preseason favorites being in the top three. Masterchef Junior continued with the pie-in-the-face-level shenanigans, and Face Off featured two covens of witches. Be warned that this episode features more discussion of googly eyes than you may be used to.;The Incomparable

Monty and Rhias are very excited about Cosplay Melee, a show where people carve craft foam into armor. And about the upcoming season of RuPaul’s Drag Race, of course. But first they have to work through the finale of the Bachelor and the latest episodes of Face Off, My Big Fat Fabulous Life, and Masterchef Junior. Although they can’t really remember anything about that last one. Some kids cooked some food, maybe?;The Incomparable

Because what everyone really wants is lots more of Corinne, right? Riiiight? My Big Fat Fabulous Life continued to prepare for the big dance battle, even though no one seems that into the idea. Face Off had an animated puppet challenge that was fairly non-creepy as animated puppet challenges go. And Masterchef Junior turned into Hell’s Kitchen Junior for a week, which annoyed Monty.;The Incomparable

It’s another great two-parter, in which we see our crew used as playthings for the Hirogen, whose only purpose is to hunt. Janeway is a French Underground leader, Seven is a torch singer, and Neelix is a badass Klingon, thanks to the holodeck. But we reserve our highest praise for Harry Kim, who had to heroically manage the ship and outwit the Hirogen. That guy deserves a promotion.;The Incomparable

We were six months into the pandemic, and Year of Hell really struck home for both of us. Tammy’s situation especially, being flung into a pandemic with an unexpectedly extended family, was akin to Captain Janeway’s challenges in the Delta Quadrant. And like Janeway, we don’t know how long it will take, but we are still on a mission to see everyone through.We’re re-releasing this episode so that it’s in chronological order with the rest of the two-parters..

She’s a fan of B’Elanna Torres and The Doctor, so we chose Revulsion (S4E5) for our homework.The story of the lonely hologram, stranded on a ship by himself, is one of the best Voyager episodes, with Torres and The Doctor forming an away team to help repair both the ship and the holographic matrix. But something is wrong, which leads to a tense and fascinating story. Guest star Leland Orser is one of the best in the Voyager series, with a creepy performance as the “isomorph” Dejaren, who resists The Doctor’s optimistic attitude towards humans.This episode is also known for Seven of Nine’s matter-of-fact rebuff of Harry Kim’s attempts to woo her as they begin work on the new astrometrics lab, and if you are a fan of Tom + B’Elanna, there’s a key moment in their newly-acknowledged attraction for each other.;The Incomparable
