This is a hobby/procrastination project.  
It can only exist because the kind people behind the respective podcast websites are ok with me doing what I do.

If you have questions, requests, or grievances, you can find me

It's hard to say how much of this I actually _own_, since I'm just collecting data that's publicly on the web.  
So to the extent of my ability I can at the very least grant you my explicit permission not be a jerk about *gestures wildly* all this.
