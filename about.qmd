This is a hobby/procrastination project.  
It can only exist because the kind people behind the respective podcast websites are ok with me doing what I do.

If you have questions, requests, or grievances, you can find me 

- in the Incomparable member slack (@jemus42)
- in the Relay FM member discord (jemus42#4242)
- on [Mastodon](https://norden.social/@jemsu)

...or by whispering you message at a passing butterfly.  
It'll find me.

It's hard to say how much of this I actually _own_, since I'm just collecting data that's publicly on the web.  
So to the extent of my ability I can at the very least grant you my explicit permission not be a jerk about *gestures wildly* all this.
